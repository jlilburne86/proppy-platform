## Data & Facts Check
- Each piece uses a standard Data Snapshot referencing `data/proppydata.json` instead of embedding unverified numbers.
- Guidance ties actions to signals (vacancy, rents YoY, listings YoY, DOM, approvals) without over‑claiming.
- Region pieces instruct to name LGA and month/quarter.

## SEO Checklist (Applied)
- Descriptive titles with primary keyword near the front.
- Meta‑length descriptions (≤160 chars) in front‑matter `description`.
- Clear H2 structure: Context → Data → Actions → Risks → Methodology.
- Internal linking ready (to be added once all 46 are finalized) — e.g., Strategy ↔ Case Studies ↔ Region Profiles.

## Accessibility & UX
- Short paragraphs, scannable bullets; explicit CTAs (“Newer” vs “Experienced”).
- Planned 3–4 visuals per article (to be added during final pass).

## Next Actions
- Fill Data Snapshots with current LGA data from `proppydata.json` per piece.
- Add 3–4 figures per article; write alt text.
- Add internal links to related guides.
- Convert to published HTML and run link + content checks.
