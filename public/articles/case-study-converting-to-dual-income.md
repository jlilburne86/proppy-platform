# Case Study: Converting to Dual Income

> Summary: Where dual‑income works, what to check before you buy, and how to keep buffers healthy during conversion.

## Key Takeaways
- Not every property is a candidate; zoning, layout and access are decisive.
- Net yield after outgoings and compliance costs matters more than top‑line rent.
- Avoid overcapitalising; scope to minimum viable conversion that tenants will value.

## Deal Filters
- Zoning/regs allow dual occupancy or secondary dwelling.
- Separate access and functional layout feasible; parking requirements satisfied.
- Capex within budget; “buffer‑safe” during conversion.

## Numbers That Matter
- Pre/post rents; expected vacancy during works; contingency (10–15%).
- New outgoings (insurance, rates, utilities splits, PM fees) vs uplift.

## Process Outline
1) Due diligence package (planning, flood, overlays, build/pest).
2) Scope works and [approvals](supply-constraints-construction-delays.html); staged payments; tight timeline.
3) Lease sequencing; adjust insurance appropriately.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Compliance risk → council pre‑lodgement advice and experienced designer/PM.
- Cost blowouts → fixed‑price where possible; contingency and staged releases.
- Tenant acceptance → plan layout for privacy, amenity and sound separation.

## Outcome Pattern (Illustrative)
- Post‑conversion gross yield improves; buffers strengthen if outgoings managed.
- Consider future saleability; avoid odd layouts that narrow buyer pool.
