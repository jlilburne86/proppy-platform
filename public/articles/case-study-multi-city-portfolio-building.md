# Case Study: Multi‑City Portfolio Building Over 8 Years

> Summary: A measured approach to buying across cycles: stabilisers first, accelerators when signals align, and strict quality filters.

## Key Takeaways
- City rotation is a tool, not a rule; insist on local signal confirmation.
- Selection discipline compounds: orientation, layout usability, and low ongoing capex.
- Periodic consolidation and debt recycling can reset buffers.

## Approach
1) Baseline stabiliser in a tight rental micro‑market.
2) Accelerator when listings tighten and DOM falls in a constrained corridor.
3) Rebalance; improve or sell B‑grade to upgrade quality.

## Risks & Controls
- Over‑concentration risk → spread by corridor and stock type, not just state.
- Cashflow strain → keep buffers, refinance only when prudent.
