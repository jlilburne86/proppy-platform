# Which Capital Cities Are Leading — and Which Are Lagging

Capital performance diverges by ring and stock type. This comparison highlights where signals are strongest now and how to standardise your city‑by‑city read.

## Market Context
- Monetary stance (RBA 3.60% in Dec 2025) sets the backdrop, but each city’s vacancy, listings and pipeline drive dispersion (RBA/ABS/PropTrack, 2025).

Examples to verify and cite:
- Several capitals and growth corridors recorded very low vacancy through late 2025 (PropTrack, 2025).
- Building approvals remained below 2021 peaks across many states into 2025 (ABS 8731.0).

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## What the Data Shows
- Inner/middle ring scarcity tends to lead; new‑build outer pockets vary with completion waves and commute realities.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | (12/2025)             | ↘/→/↗     | Read strength/weakness in leasing across capitals. |
| Rents (YoY)         | (2025)                | ↗/→/↘     | Confirms where pressure is building or fading. |
| Listings (YoY)      | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→/↗     | Scarcity vs build‑up of for‑sale stock. |
| DOM                 | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→/↗     | Speed of absorption and buyer depth. |
| Building approvals  | (2025)                | ↘/→/↗     | Future supply pressure by state and dwelling type. |
| Investor lending    | (2025)                | →         | Participation shifts affect competition. |

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## City Snapshots (Qualitative)
- Sydney: Inner/middle ring scarcity supports selected houses and quality units; outer‑ring results vary with new‑build delivery and commutes.
- Melbourne: Conditions diverge by corridor; monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth areas; stock quality matters.
- Brisbane/SEQ: Demand across SEQ hubs has supported rents; watch vacancy and listings by corridor when comparing house yield plays and unit options.
- Perth: Tight vacancy in many suburbs has supported rents; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.
- Adelaide: Low vacancy across several rings has aided leasing; assess stock quality and amenity proximity for resilience.
- Hobart: Smaller market dynamics amplify shifts; validate vacancy and rent trends locally.
- Canberra: Public‑sector stability supports leasing depth; monitor vacancy and new supply around major projects.
- Darwin: Demand can be volatile; watch migration/employment trends and project cycles.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State rule changes (tenancy, short‑stay) shift leasing settings; confirm timing and details.
- Supply shifts: Approval/completion waves can loosen tight markets; track ABS/state releases.
- Migration & Employment: Changes in flows and labour shape rental pressure; monitor ABS and PropTrack/industry commentary.
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates alter buyer depth; follow RBA and lenders.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Define a 6‑metric dashboard; refresh monthly.
- Shortlist 3 suburbs that meet yield or growth criteria; run standard DD (zoning, overlays, stock quality).
- Timebox research (e.g., 2 weeks), then inspect and decide.

### For Experienced Investors
- Standardise cross‑state DD; set alerts for key signals.
- Run sensitivity (rent −5% / interest +1.5%) before offers.
- Sequence portfolio: Add a yield stabiliser if buffers are thin; lean into growth when signals align.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
