# Brisbane Growth Corridors: Ipswich, Logan and Moreton Bay

> Summary: A single framework to compare three SEQ corridors using vacancy, rents, listings, DOM and [approvals](supply-constraints-construction-delays.html) — then decide when to buy, what to buy, and what to avoid.

## Key Takeaways
- Treat each corridor as a portfolio sleeve; don’t average them. Micro‑location selection is the edge.
- Demand (vacancy/rents) + buyer depth (listings/DOM) + pipeline (approvals/completions) = timing.
- Quality selection protects outcomes: orientation, layout, liveability, flood/noise risk.

## Market Context
SEQ has seen sustained interest due to affordability relative to inner‑Sydney/Melbourne and livability improvements. That also brings dispersion: inner/middle rings, new estates and established suburbs move differently even within the same LGA.

## Data Snapshot (Proppy)
- For Ipswich, Logan, Moreton Bay — capture: Vacancy, Rents YoY, Listings YoY, DOM, Gross yield, Price growth (3y/5y/10y) from `data/proppydata.json`.
- Confirm corridor differences rather than averaging. Record print months/quarters.

## What the Data Shows
- Yield tilt: where vacancy remains tight and rents are still climbing, resilient cashflow plays can work — if stock quality is sound.
- Growth tilt: falling DOM and tightening listings are your tells; insist on quality and scarcity.
- Watch supply: approvals/completions inflecting upward can ease rental pressure 12–24 months out.

## Investor Actions
### Newer Investors
- Shortlist 2–3 LGAs; create a simple dashboard and refresh monthly.
- Walk the streets (or Maps): verify noise, flood, slope, access and practical floor plans.
- Price discipline: base offers on recent comparable sales and rent evidence, not aspirational asks.

### Experienced Investors
- Build a barbell: stabiliser asset in the tightest rental pocket; accelerator asset in a corridor with improving buyer depth.
- Pre‑screen strata/body‑corp outgoings and special levies; avoid yield mirages.

## Risks & What to Watch
- Planning changes and infrastructure timing; staging can shift timelines and rental pressure.
- Insurance and flood exposure; price the risk and demand discounts when warranted.

## Methodology
- Multi‑signal confirmation; corridor‑level data + property‑level DD.
- Update your thesis every quarter; avoid stale reads.
