# Units vs Houses: How Performance Has Changed Over the Decade

Stock type matters. Houses and units respond differently to rents, supply and borrowing conditions. This article compares the segments, highlights where exceptions live, and offers a practical dashboard to guide decisions.

## Market Context
- Houses tend to lead cycles in scarcity‑constrained inner/middle rings; units can offer better entry yields and cyclical catch‑ups where vacancy is tight and new supply is limited.
- In high‑construction pockets, unit performance depends heavily on completions and investor turnover; house results hinge on land scarcity and micro‑location quality (ABS/PropTrack/CoreLogic, 2024–2025).

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## What the Data Shows
- Units: Higher entry yields in select inner/middle rings where vacancy is tight and supply pipelines are limited; watch owners corp quality and strata levies.
- Houses: Scarcity of well‑located land supports price resilience; rental uplift depends on bedroom mix, condition and amenity.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | (12/2025)             | ↘/→       | Tight vacancy supports rental uplift in both segments. |
| Rents (YoY)         | (2025)                | ↗/→       | Yield stabilisers for units; supports house holding buffers. |
| Listings (YoY)      | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Scarcity aids houses first; unit effect varies by pipeline. |
| DOM                 | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Faster selling/letting indicates stronger demand depth. |
| Building approvals  | (2025)                | ↘         | Lower pipelines favour both where demand persists. |
| Investor lending    | (2025)                | →         | Segment competition shifts with investor participation. |

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation; track compliance costs (bond, notice, minimum standards).
- Supply shocks: Completion waves in unit‑heavy pockets can loosen rents; track approvals and pre‑sales risk.
- Migration & Employment: Demand around universities, hospitals and employment nodes shifts leasing depth (ABS/PropTrack commentary).
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change investor participation; monitor RBA and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Define a 6‑metric dashboard; refresh monthly.
- Shortlist 3 suburbs that meet yield or growth criteria; run standard DD (zoning, overlays, stock quality).
- Timebox research (e.g., 2 weeks), then inspect and decide.

### For Experienced Investors
- Standardise cross‑state DD; set alerts for key signals.
- Run sensitivity (rent −5% / interest +1.5%) before offers.
- Sequence portfolio: Add a yield stabiliser if buffers are thin; lean into growth when signals align.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
