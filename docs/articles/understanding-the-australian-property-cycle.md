# Understanding the Australian Property Cycle

Cycles are driven by credit conditions, supply pipelines and tenant demand. This primer breaks the cycle into phases and shows which signals to monitor at each stage—and how to turn them into decisions.

## Market Context
- Monetary stance: The RBA cash rate target sat at 3.60% on 10 Dec 2025 (RBA). Earlier easing in 2025 improved serviceability modestly but from a higher baseline than 2021–2022.
- Supply: Approvals and commencements were materially below 2021 peaks through 2024–2025 in parts of the country, shaping medium‑term rental pressure (ABS).
- Demand: Migration and employment conditions influence tenant demand and turnover; always read vacancy and leasing times locally (PropTrack, 2025).

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## What the Data Shows
- Expansion: Falling DOM and tightening listings often precede broader price gains.
- Slowdown: DOM lengthens, listings build, rent momentum softens first in vulnerable stock types.
- Repair: Stabilising vacancy and listings with steady rents mark early repair phases even if prices are flat.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | (12/2025)             | ↘/→       | Tight vacancy supports yields and leasing certainty. |
| Rents (YoY)         | (2025)                | ↗/→       | Rent growth boosts gross yield and buffers. |
| Listings (YoY)      | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Scarcity can support prices; rising stock can loosen conditions. |
| DOM                 | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Faster sales often signal stronger buyer depth. |
| Building approvals  | (2025)                | ↘         | Lower approvals today can mean tighter future rentals. |
| Investor lending    | (2025)                | →         | Participation shifts influence competition and timing. |

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State rule changes (tenancy, short‑stay) affect holding costs and leasing dynamics; confirm timing and scope.
- Supply shocks: Rapid approval/release cycles can swing conditions; track ABS approvals and local completions.
- Migration & Employment: Demand shifts with flows and job markets; watch ABS and RBA commentary.
- Cost & Rates: Assessment rate changes and funding costs affect buyer depth; follow RBA and lender updates.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Define a 6‑metric dashboard; refresh monthly.
- Shortlist 3 suburbs that meet yield or growth criteria; run standard DD (zoning, overlays, stock quality).
- Timebox research (e.g., 2 weeks), then inspect and decide.

### For Experienced Investors
- Standardise cross‑state DD; set alerts for key signals.
- Run sensitivity (rent −5% / interest +1.5%) before offers.
- Sequence portfolio: Add a yield stabiliser if buffers are thin; lean into growth when signals align.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
