# Quarterly Review: East Coast Capitals

Quarterly reads help you separate signal from noise. This review frames Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane using the same dashboard — vacancy, rents, listings and DOM — and shows how to turn that into practical actions.

## How to Read Quarterly Changes
- Direction over precision: focus on up/flat/down in vacancy, rents, listings and DOM.
- Confirmation: look for 2–3 consecutive prints lining up before changing strategy.
- Suburb over city: use city reads to aim your suburb shortlist; then go granular.

Examples to verify and cite:
- Vacancy remained low in several markets through late 2025–early 2026, with sub‑1% periods in some corridors [CHECK: PropTrack/Domain vacancy, mm/yyyy, city/suburb].
- New dwelling approvals eased from 2021 peaks before stabilising in 2024–2025, varying by state [CHECK: ABS 8731.0, mm/yyyy, NSW/VIC/QLD lines].

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## City Snapshots (Qualitative)
- Sydney: Tight vacancy in select inner/middle rings; listings pockets vary; DOM falling where buyer depth improved.
- Melbourne: Mixed conditions by corridor; monitor listings and DOM for recovery signals and validate rent momentum.
- Brisbane: Broad rental pressure across several hubs; watch vacancy and listings by corridor to balance yield vs growth.

## 🔍 Proppy Checklist
- Pull latest quarter for vacancy, rents, listings and DOM per city; note direction.
- Translate to suburb shortlist; confirm locally with PMs.
- Set alerts for the next print to confirm or challenge your read.

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation [CHECK source/date]; watch compliance costs.
- Supply Shocks: Catch‑up in approvals/completions can temper rents; track ABS approvals monthly.
- Migration & Employment: Shifts in interstate/overseas flows and labour markets alter rental pressure [CHECK: ABS/RBA].
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change buyer depth; monitor RBA statements and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Define a 6‑metric dashboard; refresh monthly.
- Shortlist 3 suburbs that meet yield or growth criteria; run standard DD (zoning, overlays, stock quality).
- Timebox research (e.g., 2 weeks), then inspect and decide.

### For Experienced Investors
- Standardise cross‑state DD; set alerts for key signals.
- Run sensitivity (rent −5% / interest +1.5%) before offers.
- Sequence portfolio: Add a yield stabiliser if buffers are thin; lean into growth when signals align.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
