## Market Context
- Stock mix and construction pipelines vary widely; inner‑city and lifestyle markets behave differently.

## Key Drivers
- Land scarcity, build costs, buyer preferences, and rental demand by tenant profile.

## What the Data Shows
- Houses lead in many suburbs with constrained land; well‑located units with limited new supply can buck the trend.

## Expert Insight
- Micro‑location and building quality matter more than the asset label; check body corp, maintenance, and pipeline.

## Investor Lens
- Beginners: ensure realistic capex and fees in cashflow.
- Experienced: find unit pockets with supply caps or unique location advantages.

## Risks & Considerations
- Over‑supply in high‑rise corridors, special levies, defect risk.

## Key Takeaways
- Let fundamentals, not labels, guide selection.

### Additional Perspective
When signals conflict, slow down and expand observation. Extend the monitoring window by a quarter, validate rent movements with on‑the‑ground leasing feedback, and compare against a neighbouring suburb with a different stock mix. If the signal persists across multiple indicators and timeframes, it deserves more weight; if it fades, file it under noise.

Policy and lending settings shape investor behaviour in ways that can be hard to model. That is why the playbook emphasises resilience: buffers, quality assets, diversified exposure, and decisions that don’t depend on predicting the next move. In practice, that means pre‑agreeing what data would cause you to act — and what would cause you to wait.
