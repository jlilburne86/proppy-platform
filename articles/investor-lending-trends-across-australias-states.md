## Market Context
- Credit trends influence demand, but lag fundamentals; combine with vacancy and rents.

## Key Drivers
- Serviceability, rate expectations, and rental conditions.

## What the Data Shows
- Investor lending share rising in some states; unchanged in others; watch momentum.

## Expert Insight
- Lending share alone isn’t a buy/sell signal; corroborate with on‑ground metrics.

## Investor Lens
- Beginners: avoid reading too much into monthly moves.
- Experienced: rotate attention to improving fundamentals early, not late.

## Risks & Considerations
- Rapid reversals if rate/macro expectations shift.

## Key Takeaways
- Track lending as one input; decisions rest on fundamentals.

### Additional Perspective
When signals conflict, slow down and expand observation. Extend the monitoring window by a quarter, validate rent movements with on‑the‑ground leasing feedback, and compare against a neighbouring suburb with a different stock mix. If the signal persists across multiple indicators and timeframes, it deserves more weight; if it fades, file it under noise.

Policy and lending settings shape investor behaviour in ways that can be hard to model. That is why the playbook emphasises resilience: buffers, quality assets, diversified exposure, and decisions that don’t depend on predicting the next move. In practice, that means pre‑agreeing what data would cause you to act — and what would cause you to wait.
