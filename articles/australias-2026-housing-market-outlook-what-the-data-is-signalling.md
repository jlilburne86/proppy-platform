## Market Context
- Mixed conditions across states; vacancy remains tight in many corridors, supply pipelines uneven.

## Key Drivers
- Migration, building costs/capacity, and credit settings.

## What the Data Shows
- Persistent rent pressure where supply lags; approvals trending below prior peaks.

## Expert Insight

## Investor Lens
- Beginners: set criteria and buffers; avoid binary bets.
- Experienced: balance risk via city/stock diversification.

## Risks & Considerations
- Forecast error; over‑confidence bias.

## Key Takeaways
- Use indicators to inform action windows; maintain flexibility.

### Additional Perspective
When signals conflict, slow down and expand observation. Extend the monitoring window by a quarter, validate rent movements with on‑the‑ground leasing feedback, and compare against a neighbouring suburb with a different stock mix. If the signal persists across multiple indicators and timeframes, it deserves more weight; if it fades, file it under noise.

Policy and lending settings shape investor behaviour in ways that can be hard to model. That is why the playbook emphasises resilience: buffers, quality assets, diversified exposure, and decisions that don’t depend on predicting the next move. In practice, that means pre‑agreeing what data would cause you to act — and what would cause you to wait.
