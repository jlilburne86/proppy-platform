# Building Your First Investment Property Portfolio

> Summary: A practical playbook for new investors to move from research to action — with a light dashboard, quality filters, and a clear risk plan.

## Key Takeaways
- Decide what you need first: a stabiliser (yield) or accelerator (growth). Sequence matters.
- Build a 6‑metric dashboard and refresh monthly; stop revisiting fundamentals every week.
- Protect buffers; buy only “buffer‑safe” deals and stress test interest +100–150 bps.

## Market Context
Markets ebb and flow, but portfolios are built on process. Most delays come from over‑researching and under‑deciding. This guide compresses research into a repeatable method that favours timely, high‑quality decisions and preserves cashflow resilience.

## Your Dashboard
- Vacancy, Rents YoY/QoQ, Listings YoY, DOM, [Approvals](articles/supply-constraints-construction-delays.html)/Pipeline, Investor Lending
- Sources: `data/proppydata.json` (local), ABS (approvals), RBA/PropTrack (context)

## Asset Selection
- Quality criteria: orientation/light, floor plan utility, noise/flood avoidance, low immediate capex.
- Strata vs freestanding: compare net yields after outgoings; avoid “cheap” high‑outgoings strata traps.

## Sequencing
- Start with the gap: thin buffers → stabiliser; strong buffers → consider accelerator in constrained micro‑location.
- One deal at a time; post‑settlement improvements before next purchase.

## Risk Controls
- Cash buffer target (e.g., 6–12 months of shortfall coverage).
- Insurance, rent reviews, maintenance schedule; pre‑purchase building and pest.

## Steps to Action
1) Pick 2–3 target LGAs; 2) Build dashboard; 3) Walk stock; 4) Shortlist 3; 5) Inspect; 6) Offer with comps and rent evidence.

## Methodology & References
- Multi‑signal confirmation; quarterly thesis updates; clear checklists.
