# Overconcentration Risk: Why One Market Is Rarely Enough

Cycles don’t move in lockstep. Concentrating in one city, corridor or stock type amplifies drawdowns and narrows opportunity. This guide outlines the evidence for spreading risk and a practical way to diversify without drift.

## Market Context
- Cities and stock types cycle differently (rates, approvals, migration, local industry). Cross‑market exposure reduces the chance of being stuck in the same phase everywhere.

Examples to verify and cite:
- Vacancy remained low in several markets through late 2025–early 2026, with sub‑1% periods in some corridors [CHECK: PropTrack/Domain vacancy, mm/yyyy, city/suburb].
- New dwelling approvals eased from 2021 peaks before stabilising in 2024–2025, varying by state [CHECK: ABS 8731.0, mm/yyyy, NSW/VIC/QLD lines].

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## What the Data Shows
- Diversification smooths cashflows and action windows; different corridors offer yield vs growth at different times.
- A “house only” or “unit only” approach can miss recoveries in the other segment; consider measured cross‑segment exposure.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | [CHECK: %]            | ↘/↗/→     | Tight vacancy supports yields and leasing certainty. |
| Rents (YoY)         | [CHECK: %]            | ↘/↗/→     | Rent growth boosts gross yield and buffers. |
| Listings (YoY)      | [CHECK: %]            | ↘/↗/→     | Scarcity can support prices; rising stock can loosen conditions. |
| DOM                 | [CHECK: days]         | ↘/↗/→     | Faster sales often signal stronger buyer depth. |
| Building approvals  | [CHECK: level/YoY]    | ↘/↗/→     | Lower approvals today can mean tighter future rentals. |
| Investor lending    | [CHECK: YoY]          | ↘/↗/→     | Participation shifts influence competition and timing. |

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation [CHECK source/date]; watch compliance costs.
- Supply Shocks: Catch‑up in approvals/completions can temper rents; track ABS approvals monthly.
- Migration & Employment: Shifts in interstate/overseas flows and labour markets alter rental pressure [CHECK: ABS/RBA].
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change buyer depth; monitor RBA statements and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Split shortlist across two cities with different profiles; run identical dashboards.
- Add one yield stabiliser before a growth‑tilted asset; keep ≥6–12 months buffer.
- Avoid doubling up on the same risk (e.g., same employer/industry hub).

### For Experienced Investors
- Use risk budgets (city/segment caps) and rotate additions when signals improve elsewhere.
- Set automated alerts for vacancy/listings/DOM in candidate corridors; act on 2–3 signal confirmation.
- Periodically rebalance by adding the opposite tilt (yield vs growth) as buffers change.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
