# Market Downturns: How Australian Property Has Historically Responded

Downturns are part of the cycle. This article reviews typical patterns—what weakens first, where resilience shows up—and offers a disciplined, data‑first process to navigate them.

## Market Context
- Financing costs: The RBA cash rate target was 3.60% on 10 Dec 2025 after earlier cuts in 2025 (RBA). Easing helps serviceability but doesn’t remove structural supply/demand constraints.
- Supply response: Approvals and commencements were below 2021 peaks into 2025 in many jurisdictions (ABS). Slow pipelines can cushion rentals in downturns.
- Demand signals: Vacancy and DOM typically adjust before price indexes; read them first and at suburb level (PropTrack/CoreLogic, 2024–2025).

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## What the Data Shows
- In slowdowns, listings often build first; price falls, if any, tend to be uneven and concentrated in over‑supplied or lower‑quality stock.
- Tight vacancy can limit rent declines even when transaction volumes soften; outer‑ring new‑build pockets behave differently to inner‑ring established stock.
- Recovery phases are marked by stabilising listings and shorter DOM before prices broadly follow.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | (12/2025)             | ↘/→       | Tight vacancy cushions rents during softer sales periods. |
| Rents (YoY)         | (2025)                | →         | Flat or modest growth supports holding buffers. |
| Listings (YoY)      | (Q4/2025)             | ↗/→       | Rising stock can pressure prices; track absorption. |
| DOM                 | (Q4/2025)             | ↗         | Longer selling times are an early warning. |
| Building approvals  | (2025)                | ↘         | Slower pipelines can aid rental tightness later. |
| Investor lending    | (2025)                | →         | Participation shifts influence competition and timing. |

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: Rule changes (notice periods, standards, short‑stay caps) can influence leasing and costs.
- Supply shocks: If approvals/completions catch up quickly, rental tightness can ease; track ABS and local project updates.
- Migration & Employment: University and industry cycles shift tenant demand; review ABS and RBA commentary.
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change buyer depth; monitor RBA decisions and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Define a 6‑metric dashboard; refresh monthly.
- Shortlist 3 suburbs that meet yield or growth criteria; run standard DD (zoning, overlays, stock quality).
- Timebox research (e.g., 2 weeks), then inspect and decide.

### For Experienced Investors
- Standardise cross‑state DD; set alerts for key signals.
- Run sensitivity (rent −5% / interest +1.5%) before offers.
- Sequence portfolio: Add a yield stabiliser if buffers are thin; lean into growth when signals align.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
