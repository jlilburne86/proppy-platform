# Case Study: Renovating for Value vs Cashflow

> Summary: Renovations work when they fix what tenants and buyers value; they fail when they chase trends or ignore layout and light.

## Key Takeaways
- Start with livability: light, ventilation, storage, layout, parking.
- Phase scope to minimum viable improvements that boost rent/saleability.
- Track actual rent uplift and absorption (days‑to‑lease) vs plan.

## Scope Checklist
- Safety first, then kitchens/bathrooms, then paint/flooring, then cosmetics.
- Avoid overcapitalising in high‑turnover tenant pockets.

## Outcome Patterns
- Balanced uplift: moderate capex → improved rent + tenant retention.
- Overcapitalised: high capex → marginal rent uplift; opportunity cost.
