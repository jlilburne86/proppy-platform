# Case Study: Managing Through Interest Rate Rises

> Summary: The investor’s edge is process — buffers, rent reviews, insurance and selective improvements — not prediction.

## Key Takeaways
- Maintain buffers (6–12 months of shortfall coverage where possible).
- Schedule rent reviews with evidence; minor improvements can support tenant acceptance.
- Avoid deferring essential maintenance that protects value and rentability.

## Playbook
- Stress test at +100–150 bps; set thresholds for action.
- If cashflow tightens, prioritise stabilisers before accelerators.
- Keep communication clear with your PM and tenants.

## Outcome
- Preserved ownership through cycle; optionality to buy when signals improve.
