# Tax Depreciation 101

Depreciation is one of the least glamorous pieces of property investing, but it’s also one of the most misunderstood. Claimed correctly, it can improve after‑tax cashflow and help you hold quality assets through cycles. Claimed poorly, it can create audit headaches or false expectations. This guide explains the framework in plain English, how schedules work, where the biggest differences occur between new and established property, and the practical steps to take with your accountant and quantity surveyor.

## Market Context

Australian tax law allows investors to claim certain non‑cash deductions on income‑producing residential property. Two broad buckets matter:

- Division 43 (Capital Works): structural/embedded elements (e.g., foundations, walls, roof, fixed tiling). These are generally written off at a low, fixed rate over decades when eligible, based on construction start dates and subsequent works.
- Division 40 (Plant & Equipment): removable items with a finite effective life (e.g., appliances, carpets, blinds, split systems). These are written off at rates that reflect their useful lives and the chosen method (diminishing value or prime cost).

Important 2017 change: for second‑hand residential properties acquired after 9 May 2017, Division 40 deductions on previously used plant and equipment are typically not available to subsequent owners. You can still claim Division 43 (where eligible) and new plant you install, but not the value of second‑hand dishwashers, carpets, etc., already in the property when you bought it. New builds and substantially renovated properties remain more favourable for Division 40.

Because rules depend on build year, asset type and usage, two seemingly similar properties can produce very different depreciation outcomes. Treat every schedule as property‑specific, and confirm assumptions with a qualified professional.

## Key Drivers

- Build year and type: Newer dwellings and substantial renovations often unlock more Division 43 and fresh Division 40 eligibility.
- Renovations timeline: Renovations by you vs prior owners have different treatment. You may need a “split” report to isolate original vs renovated components.
- Stock type and quality: A house with higher‑spec finishes can have more (eligible) plant than a basic unit — or the opposite if the unit is part of a recently built complex.
- Effective life and method: ATO effective life tables determine rates; method choice (diminishing value vs prime cost) changes the timing of deductions (front‑loaded vs flatter).
- Usage pattern: If the property is income‑producing for only part of a year, claims are pro‑rated. Private use breaks the chain.

## What the Data Shows (Qualitative Ranges)

Because schedules are case‑specific, be wary of generic promises. That said, experienced quantity surveyors see broad patterns:

- New builds (or substantial renovations) often generate higher first‑year claims due to fresh Division 40 assets and maximum Division 43 eligibility.
- Established properties acquired post‑2017 generally lean on Division 43 (structural) unless you add new plant (e.g., replacing carpet, installing a new split system).
- Renovation programs can materially change claims if they add new qualifying assets and capital works — but a schedule can’t create deductions where eligibility doesn’t exist.

The right question isn’t “How big is the deduction?” but “How certain and defensible is the claim given the property’s specifics?”

## A Practical Refresher on Division 43 vs Division 40

Division 43 (Capital Works)

- Covers structural/embedded items. Rate commonly 2.5% per annum for eligible periods (some legacy rates differ). Eligibility depends on construction start date and whether the dwelling qualifies as residential capital works.
- Substantial renovations reset the clock for the renovated portion. Evidence is king: plans, invoices, council approvals.

Division 40 (Plant & Equipment)

- Covers removable assets with assessable effective lives (e.g., oven, cooktop, hot water system, carpets, blinds, split systems).
- Post‑2017 rule limits claims on second‑hand plant for residential investors; however, new assets you install after purchase are claimable.
- Method: Diminishing value front‑loads claims; prime cost spreads them evenly. Your accountant should advise which suits your circumstances.

## New Build vs Established: How Outcomes Typically Differ

- New build: Expect a more substantial schedule due to eligible capital works and brand‑new plant installed by the developer. First‑year claims are often materially higher, tapering over time.
- Established (post‑2017 acquisition): Capital works still matter. But most plant present at purchase is not claimable as Division 40. New plant you add is claimable from installation.
- Substantial renovation (genuine): Can behave much like a new build for the renovated portion, if the work meets the legal definition and is evidenced.

Tip: For established properties, a quantity surveyor can still prepare a useful schedule that prioritises Division 43 and any new assets you install. The report should clearly document assumptions and dates.

## How a Quantity Surveyor (QS) Schedule Is Built

1. Evidence collection: settlement documentation, plans, build date, renovation evidence, invoices, inspection notes/photos.
2. Costing & effective life: assigning values to eligible components, referencing ATO effective life tables and legislation.
3. Method election: diminishing value or prime cost (with your accountant’s input).
4. Year‑by‑year schedule: tabular projection showing claimable amounts per category and year, including pro‑rata for partial‑year income use.
5. Integration: accountant imports schedule to tax software; you retain report + evidence.

Turnaround is typically days to a couple of weeks. Keep digital records with your property files.

## Worked Scenarios (Illustrative Only)

Scenario A: New build townhouse, completed this year

- Fresh Division 43 starts; developer installed new Division 40 assets (appliances, blinds, AC, HWS, etc.).
- Diminishing value usually yields higher early‑year deductions; prime cost smooths them. Choice depends on your tax planning and accountant advice.

Scenario B: 1998 brick home acquired in 2024 (established)

- Existing second‑hand plant at purchase is typically not claimable under Division 40 (post‑2017 rule).
- Division 43 may still apply to the original structure depending on build date and eligibility.
- If you replace carpet and add a new split system, those new assets become claimable from installation.

Scenario C: Substantial renovation by prior owner finalized 2022

- A genuine substantial renovation can reset eligibility for the renovated portion. Your QS splits original vs renovated elements and dates, with claims following the renovation timeline.

These scenarios highlight why one property’s schedule tells you little about another’s — the dates, works and assets matter more than the headline label.

## Expert Insight: Getting It Right

- Order the schedule early: Engage a reputable QS as soon as practical after settlement and once works (if any) are finished.
- Coordinate with your accountant: Align on method (diminishing vs prime cost), timing, and treatment of partial‑year income use.
- Evidence beats estimates: Keep invoices, plans, renovation approvals, and photos. If prior owners completed works, ask for documentation during due diligence.
- Review annually: Update the schedule after material upgrades (e.g., new AC, kitchen/bath refresh). Capture disposal/retirement of assets.
- Don’t stretch eligibility: Conservative, well‑evidenced claims travel best through audits.

## Investor Lens

For beginners

- Depreciation is not “free money” — it’s a non‑cash deduction that reduces taxable income on an income‑producing property. You still need realistic cashflow, buffers, and quality assets.
- Ask for a pre‑purchase estimate only as a sanity check. The real schedule is prepared post‑purchase and/or post‑renovation with evidence.

For experienced investors

- Standardise your process: QS engagement, evidence archiving, accountant sign‑off. Automate reminders to revisit schedules after upgrades.
- Think portfolio‑wide: Depreciation helps holding power, but strategy rests on fundamentals — location, demand drivers, and asset quality.

## Risks & Considerations

- Legislative change: Rules evolve. The 2017 change for second‑hand plant is a reminder to avoid building a strategy on tax rules alone.
- Documentation gaps: Thin evidence weakens claims — and can delay or reduce defensible deductions.
- Over‑estimation: Inflated values or incorrect asset classification create audit risk. Use reputable professionals.
- Private use periods: Claims must be pro‑rated; short‑term private use interrupts eligibility.

## Practical Checklist

- Confirm construction dates and any substantial renovations (with documents).
- Decide with your accountant on method (diminishing value vs prime cost) and timing.
- Engage a reputable QS; provide all plans, invoices, and photos.
- Record upgrades; request an addendum report when you add or retire assets.
- File schedules alongside tax returns for future reference; keep digital backups.

## Key Takeaways

- Depreciation is a tool for cashflow resilience, not a substitute for fundamentals.
- New builds and genuine substantial renovations generally unlock more claimable components — but evidence decides.
- Established properties can still claim capital works and new assets added post‑purchase.
- Conservative, well‑documented schedules integrate smoothly with tax compliance.
