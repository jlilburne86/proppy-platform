# Tax Depreciation 101

Depreciation can improve after‑tax cashflow without changing the asset’s fundamentals. This guide explains schedules, eligible items, how the rules differ for new vs established dwellings, and how to work with a quantity surveyor.

## What Matters (Not Market Conditions)
- Depreciation is a tax concept, not a market signal. Focus on build year, renovations, and the asset’s plant & equipment and capital works components.
- The ATO’s 2017 changes limit deductions for second‑hand plant & equipment in established properties acquired after 9 May 2017; capital works deductions still apply (seek tax advice).

Examples to verify and cite:
- Vacancy remained low in several markets through late 2025–early 2026, with sub‑1% periods in some corridors [CHECK: PropTrack/Domain vacancy, mm/yyyy, city/suburb].
- New dwelling approvals eased from 2021 peaks before stabilising in 2024–2025, varying by state [CHECK: ABS 8731.0, mm/yyyy, NSW/VIC/QLD lines].

## Key Concepts
- Capital works (Division 43): Generally 2.5% p.a. over 40 years on eligible construction costs.
- Plant & equipment (Division 40): Depreciable assets like carpets, appliances — subject to acquisition date rules.
- New vs established: New builds often have larger claim pools; established can still claim capital works and new items added post‑purchase.
- Quantity surveyor reports: Often required to substantiate claims; update after substantial renovations.

## Practical Examples (Illustrative)
- Capital works: $200,000 eligible → $5,000 p.a. for up to 40 years.
- Plant & equipment: New appliances $8,000 → depreciate per effective life schedule.
- Record‑keeping: Keep invoices, dates, and photos; log renovations separately.

## 🔍 Proppy Checklist
- Confirm build date and acquisition date (ATO rules differ by date).
- Arrange a quantity surveyor report; update after renovations.
- Separate schedules for capital works vs plant & equipment.
- Keep evidence (invoices, photos); store securely for tax time.

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation [CHECK source/date]; watch compliance costs.
- Supply Shocks: Catch‑up in approvals/completions can temper rents; track ABS approvals monthly.
- Migration & Employment: Shifts in interstate/overseas flows and labour markets alter rental pressure [CHECK: ABS/RBA].
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change buyer depth; monitor RBA statements and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Ask PM and builder for construction dates and scope.
- Commission a quantity surveyor; store the report with your records.
- Discuss with your tax adviser how to apply schedules.

### For Experienced Investors
- Standardise documentation across the portfolio; calendar reviews before EOFY.
- Re‑run schedules after upgrades to capture new eligible items.
- Coordinate with finance strategy to time renovations and claims appropriately.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
