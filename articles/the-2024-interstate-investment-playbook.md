# The 2024 Interstate Investment Playbook

Interstate investing broadens the opportunity set and diversifies risk, but it only works with a disciplined, data‑led process. This playbook shows how to compare states on the same dashboard, set up on‑the‑ground support, and execute inspections, offers and settlements cleanly.

## Market Context
- Rates & credit: RBA 3.60% (Dec 2025) provides the backdrop, but serviceability varies by lender; assess borrowing capacity before shortlisting (RBA).
- Dispersion: Vacancy, rents, listings and approvals differ by city/region, so a single national view is misleading; compare like‑for‑like timeframes (ABS/PropTrack/CoreLogic, 2024–2025).

Examples to verify and cite:
- Vacancy remained low in several markets through late 2025–early 2026, with sub‑1% periods in some corridors [CHECK: PropTrack/Domain vacancy, mm/yyyy, city/suburb].
- New dwelling approvals eased from 2021 peaks before stabilising in 2024–2025, varying by state [CHECK: ABS 8731.0, mm/yyyy, NSW/VIC/QLD lines].

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## What the Data Shows
- Long‑run (10–20y): Compounding and holding quality assets through cycles dominate outcomes (CoreLogic indexes, [CHECK series & date]).
- 12–24m momentum: Some corridors show strong rent growth with modest price gains, others the reverse [CHECK: PropTrack/ABS rents, CoreLogic price indexes, mm/yyyy].
- Last 1–3 quarters: Listings, vacancy, and approvals provide near‑term signal; confirm across 2–3 updates to avoid noise.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | [CHECK: %]            | ↘/↗/→     | Tight vacancy supports yields and leasing certainty. |
| Rents (YoY)         | [CHECK: %]            | ↘/↗/→     | Rent growth boosts gross yield and buffers. |
| Listings (YoY)      | [CHECK: %]            | ↘/↗/→     | Scarcity can support prices; rising stock can loosen conditions. |
| DOM                 | [CHECK: days]         | ↘/↗/→     | Faster sales often signal stronger buyer depth. |
| Building approvals  | [CHECK: level/YoY]    | ↘/↗/→     | Lower approvals today can mean tighter future rentals. |
| Investor lending    | [CHECK: YoY]          | ↘/↗/→     | Participation shifts influence competition and timing. |

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Build a cross‑state dashboard: vacancy, rents YoY, listings YoY, DOM, approvals (12‑month totals), investor lending.
- Normalise time windows (e.g., last 12m and last 3 prints) to compare momentum.
- Qualitative overlay: zoning, overlays, stock quality, and commuting realities — by suburb.
- Ops: Engage a local PM before offers; define inspections, photos, and report standards.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation [CHECK source/date]; watch compliance costs.
- Supply Shocks: Catch‑up in approvals/completions can temper rents; track ABS approvals monthly.
- Migration & Employment: Shifts in interstate/overseas flows and labour markets alter rental pressure [CHECK: ABS/RBA].
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change buyer depth; monitor RBA statements and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Choose two states with complementary profiles (e.g., yield stabiliser vs growth tilt).
- Build identical dashboards for 3 suburbs per state; call two PMs in each.
- Line up remote inspections with photo/video standards; pre‑book B&P.

### For Experienced Investors
- Automate alerts; cut decisions to a 2‑week window once signals align.
- Use a “two‑bid” play: one asset under offer, one as back‑up; pre‑negotiated finance.
- Sequence across states to diversify policy/regulatory risk.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
