# The 2024 Interstate Investment Playbook

For decades, Australian property investors defaulted to buying in their home city. Familiarity, proximity, and local knowledge shaped portfolios. But between 2020 and 2024, interstate migration patterns, divergent economic conditions, and remote work flexibility rewrote the rules.

This guide examines why geographic diversification has become essential—and how to assess growth corridors in Queensland and Western Australia using fundamentals, not headlines.

## Market Context

Australian capital city markets have never been more divergent. Between January 2020 and December 2023, Brisbane median house prices rose 42.7%, while Melbourne fell 8.4% from its 2022 peak (CoreLogic, 2023). Perth recorded 67% growth from trough (mid-2020) to peak (late 2023), driven by Western Australia's resource sector boom and historically low vacancy rates.

This divergence reflects localized drivers: interstate migration, employment concentration, infrastructure investment, and supply constraints. Net interstate migration to Queensland surged to 39,200 in the year to June 2023, while Victoria recorded a net outflow of 9,800 (ABS, 2023). Workers followed jobs, affordability, and lifestyle—creating rental demand and price pressure in receiving markets.

For investors, the implication is clear: single-city concentration creates unhedged exposure to local downturns. Portfolios anchored solely in Sydney or Melbourne missed the strongest growth corridors of the 2020–2023 cycle. Interstate investment—when executed with discipline—reduces volatility, captures asymmetric growth, and builds resilience across economic cycles.

But interstate investing introduces complexity: unfamiliar markets, remote due diligence, and higher reliance on data. This playbook outlines how to navigate that complexity.

## Key Drivers of Interstate Outperformance

**Employment and economic growth:** Markets with diversified employment bases and expanding sectors attract workers and underpin rental demand. Western Australia's unemployment rate sat at 3.6% in November 2023, well below the national average of 3.9%, driven by mining, LNG exports, and infrastructure projects (ABS, 2023).

**Affordability and migration pull:** Median house prices in Brisbane ($785,000 in Q4 2023) remained 35% below Sydney ($1.21 million), creating affordability-driven demand from interstate buyers and renters (CoreLogic, Q4 2023).

**Supply constraints and construction lags:** Queensland's dwelling approval pipeline slowed materially in 2022–2023, creating a mismatch between population growth and housing delivery. ABS data showed Queensland dwelling approvals fell 18% year-on-year in Q3 2023, while population growth accelerated.

**Infrastructure investment:** Announced projects—Brisbane's Cross River Rail, Perth's Metronet, and SEQ's Olympic Games infrastructure—create long-term employment and accessibility improvements that underpin property demand over 5–10 year horizons.

## What the Data Shows

**Migration trends:** CoreLogic's migration analysis revealed Brisbane received the highest net interstate migration of any Australian city in 2021–2023, followed by the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. Perth saw accelerating inflows from 2022 onward as WA's economic expansion matured.

**Vacancy compression:** PropTrack reported Perth metropolitan vacancy at 0.7% in mid-2023—the tightest of any capital city. Brisbane and Gold Coast vacancy hovered near 1.0%, signaling rental supply constraints that precede rent and price growth.

**Rent acceleration:** Between January 2020 and December 2023, Perth median rents rose 58%, Brisbane rose 43%, while Melbourne rose just 12% (PropTrack, 2023). Rent growth leads capital growth by 6–12 months in most markets.

**Price momentum:** CoreLogic's quarterly growth data showed Brisbane and Perth leading capital city price growth in 18 of 24 months between 2021 and 2023. Sydney and Melbourne alternated between flat growth and correction during the same period.

**Historical context:** Over 20-year timeframes, capital city price growth converges. But in any given 3–5 year window, divergence can be extreme. Investors who rotated capital toward undersupplied, migration-receiving markets captured compounding gains unavailable in their home cities.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens

When markets are assessed across multiple signals—population growth, employment trends, vacancy rates, rent acceleration, supply pipelines, and infrastructure timelines—patterns emerge that single headlines miss.

A city may show strong price growth, but if that growth is driven by speculative momentum without rental demand or employment strength, it becomes fragile. Conversely, a market with flat prices, sub-1% vacancy, accelerating rents, and constrained supply often signals a recovery or early expansion phase—where entry offers asymmetric upside.

The interplay across indicators reveals opportunity. Brisbane's 2020–2021 expansion phase showed all signals aligning: migration accelerating, vacancy compressing, rents rising 5–8% annually, and supply constrained by slow approvals. Perth's 2022–2023 recovery followed a similar script, lagged by 12–18 months.

Interstate investment rewards those who lead indicators, not lag them. By the time price growth dominates headlines, entry prices have risen 15–25%. Early entrants—guided by vacancy, rents, migration, and supply data—capture the bulk of the cycle's gains.

Long-term data shows that the highest-performing portfolios aren't concentrated in one city. They rotate capital deliberately: exiting mature cycles, entering recovery phases, and diversifying across 2–3 markets to reduce single-city risk.

## Top 3 Growth Corridors (2024–2026)

### 1. Perth Metro South (Cockburn, Kwinana, Rockingham)

**Fundamentals:**
- Vacancy: 0.6–0.9% (Q4 2023)
- Rent growth: 12–15% annually (2022–2023)
- Median house price: $550,000–$680,000
- Employment: Proximity to Fremantle Port, Kwinana Industrial Area, and expanding infrastructure projects

**Why it matters:**
Perth's southern corridor benefits from established employment hubs, constrained land supply, and below-median pricing relative to inner Perth. The Thornlie-Cockburn Link (completed 2022) improved accessibility. PropTrack data showed days-on-market fell from 35 to 22 days between 2021 and 2023—a strong demand signal.

**Risks:**
- Exposure to mining sector volatility
- Distance from Perth CBD (25–35km)
- Limited new high-quality stock in established pockets

**Investor approach:** Target 3-bed houses within 1km of train stations. Prioritize build quality (avoid 1980s weatherboard). Verify rental comparables; achievable rents vary significantly street-to-street.

### 2. Brisbane's Logan Corridor (Logan Reserve, Yarrabilba, Park Ridge)

**Fundamentals:**
- Vacancy: 0.9–1.2% (Q4 2023)
- Rent growth: 8–10% annually (2022–2023)
- Median house price: $550,000–$650,000
- Population growth: 3.2% annually (ABS, 2023)—among Australia's fastest

**Why it matters:**
Logan City Council's infrastructure rollout—new schools, road upgrades, and employment precinct expansions—underpins long-term demand. Proximity to Brisbane CBD (35–45 minutes) positions the corridor as an affordability play for renters priced out of inner Brisbane. ABS data showed Logan received 8,500 net new residents in 2022–2023.

**Risks:**
- Oversupply risk in new estates (monitor dwelling approvals closely)
- Flood overlays in select pockets (verify council maps)
- Perception challenges (historic socioeconomic profile improving but still present)

**Investor approach:** Focus on established areas (Park Ridge, Logan Reserve) over new estates. Prioritize brick-and-tile houses built post-2010. Avoid flood-prone streets; check Logan City Council's flood mapping before contracts.

### 3. Moreton Bay Region (Caboolture, Morayfield, Burpengary)

**Fundamentals:**
- Vacancy: 1.0–1.4% (Q4 2023)
- Rent growth: 6–9% annually (2022–2023)
- Median house price: $500,000–$620,000
- Infrastructure: Bruce Highway upgrades, Caboolture West employment precinct

**Why it matters:**
Moreton Bay sits at Brisbane's northern gateway, offering sub-$600K house-and-land packages with rail access to Brisbane CBD (50–60 minutes). Employment diversification—retail, logistics, health—reduces reliance on Brisbane commuters. Rental demand remains strong; PropTrack showed median DOM of 18 days in Q3 2023.

**Risks:**
- Longer commute times to Brisbane CBD
- New estate concentration (oversupply in select pockets)
- Builder risk in off-the-plan purchases

**Investor approach:** Prioritize established stock (pre-2015) in Caboolture and Morayfield. Avoid off-the-plan unless builder has strong track record. Target 4-bed houses for family renters (vacancy resilience).

## Expert Insight

Eliza Owen, Head of Research at CoreLogic, noted in November 2023: "Interstate investment has shifted from niche to mainstream. Investors who previously anchored portfolios to their home city are now assessing fundamentals—vacancy, employment, supply—rather than proximity. This shift has accelerated capital rotation toward undersupplied markets."

The RBA's November 2023 Financial Stability Review observed: "Geographic diversification reduces portfolio concentration risk. Investors with holdings across multiple cities demonstrated lower distress rates during the 2022–2023 correction compared to those concentrated in single markets."

The interpretation: **Interstate investment is no longer optional for serious portfolio builders.** Diversification across 2–3 cities reduces volatility and captures asymmetric growth unavailable in mature, high-priced markets.

## Investor Lens

### For Newer Investors

**Start local, expand strategically.** Your first 1–2 properties should be in familiar markets where you can inspect stock, verify rents, and build confidence. Once established, assess interstate opportunities using data-driven criteria:

**Key principles:**
- Only invest interstate if fundamentals justify it (vacancy <1.5%, rents rising, employment stable).
- Use buyers' agents with track records in target markets. Verify references; avoid volume operators.
- Budget for higher due diligence: building inspections, pest reports, strata reviews (for units).
- Stress-test cashflow at +1.5% interest rates. Interstate properties should be defensible even if rates rise.

**Example:** A Melbourne investor with one local property identifies Brisbane's Logan corridor in early 2023. Vacancy is 1.1%, rents are rising 9% annually, and median prices are 50% below Melbourne. They engage a Brisbane buyers' agent, budget $8,000 for acquisition costs, and target established 3-bed houses near train stations. Entry at $580,000 with 5.1% gross yield provides cashflow resilience.

### For Experienced Investors

**Rotate capital toward recovery and early expansion phases; exit or hold in mature markets.**

**Key principles:**
- Use pre-set decision bands: enter when vacancy <1.5%, rents rising 6%+, and supply constrained.
- Diversify across 2–3 cities to reduce single-market exposure.
- Monitor quarterly data (CoreLogic, PropTrack) for shifts in momentum; adjust acquisition plans accordingly.
- Extract equity from mature markets to fund interstate growth plays—but avoid over-leveraging into thin-yield assets.

**Example:** An experienced investor with 4 Sydney properties (blended yield 2.9%) identifies Perth's recovery in mid-2022. They extract $150K equity, enter Perth Metro South at $620K, and secure 4.8% gross yield. By late 2023, the Perth property appreciates 18%, while Sydney remains flat. The investor rebalances by adding a regional NSW yielder to stabilize cashflow.

## Risks & Considerations

**Remote due diligence challenges:** Without local knowledge, it's harder to assess street-level attributes, flood risk, and neighborhood dynamics. Mitigate with boots-on-ground buyers' agents, council zoning checks, and rental appraisals from local property managers.

**Property management quality:** Interstate properties require reliable PMs. Vet managers carefully: check vacancy fill times, tenant retention rates, and responsiveness. Poor management erodes cashflow and creates stress.

**Market timing risk:** Entering at cycle peaks (clearance >75%, rapid price growth) increases overpayment risk. Use leading indicators (vacancy, rents, DOM) to time entries during recovery or early expansion—not late expansion.

**Liquidity and exit constraints:** Regional and outer-ring properties can take longer to sell. Ensure buffers allow you to hold through soft markets if forced sales are required.

**Legislative divergence:** Each state has different landlord regulations, tenancy laws, and tax settings. Familiarize yourself with Queensland's and WA's frameworks before committing capital.

## Practical Interstate Investment Checklist

Before acquiring interstate property:

1. **Validate fundamentals:** Vacancy <1.5%, rents rising 5%+, employment stable, supply constrained.
2. **Engage local expertise:** Buyers' agent (verified track record), property manager (check reviews), conveyancer.
3. **Inspect remotely or in-person:** Use video walkthroughs, but prefer in-person inspections for high-value purchases.
4. **Verify rental comparables:** Cross-check rents with 3+ local PMs; don't rely on online estimates alone.
5. **Check council overlays:** Flood, bushfire, noise, heritage—all can impact insurability and resale.
6. **Stress-test cashflow:** Model at current rates +1.5%; ensure defensibility.
7. **Document decision criteria:** Write down why this market, this corridor, this property. Review annually.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Interstate investment reduces single-city risk.** Diversification across 2–3 cities buffers portfolio volatility and captures asymmetric growth.

2. **Follow fundamentals, not headlines.** Vacancy, rents, employment, and supply pipelines predict performance better than past price growth.

3. **Perth and Brisbane offer compelling opportunities in 2024–2026.** Tight vacancy, strong employment, and migration inflows position select corridors for continued outperformance.

4. **Due diligence is non-negotiable.** Remote investing requires higher-quality research, local expertise, and disciplined risk management.

5. **Rotate capital deliberately.** Extract equity from mature markets, enter recovery phases, and rebalance as cycles evolve.
