# Interest Rates: The 2024 Forecast

Rate paths affect serviceability and sentiment, but plans shouldn’t rest on a single prediction. Here’s how to prepare portfolios across scenarios.

## Market Context
- Outlooks vary; focus on implications rather than exact timing.

## Key Drivers
- Funding costs, wage growth, and bank assessment rates.

## What the Data Shows
- Past cycles show differing lags across markets; keep scenarios broad.

## Expert Insight
- Build buffers and flexibility into acquisition plans; avoid rate‑timing as a strategy.

## Investor Lens
- Beginners: assess buffer size and cashflow under higher rates.
- Experienced: stage acquisitions; keep optionality on settlement timing.

## Risks & Considerations
- Forecast error, liquidity risk, and fixed/variable mix choices.

## Key Takeaways
- Plan for ranges, not point estimates; prioritise resilience.
- Monitor serviceability settings and pass‑through to rents.

### Additional Perspective
When signals conflict, slow down and expand observation. Extend the monitoring window by a quarter, validate rent movements with on‑the‑ground leasing feedback, and compare against a neighbouring suburb with a different stock mix. If the signal persists across multiple indicators and timeframes, it deserves more weight; if it fades, file it under noise.

Policy and lending settings shape investor behaviour in ways that can be hard to model. That is why the playbook emphasises resilience: buffers, quality assets, diversified exposure, and decisions that don’t depend on predicting the next move. In practice, that means pre‑agreeing what data would cause you to act — and what would cause you to wait.
