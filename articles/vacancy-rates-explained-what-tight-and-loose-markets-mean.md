# Vacancy Rates Explained: What Tight and Loose Markets Mean

Vacancy is a leading indicator for rental pressure and leasing risk. This explainer shows how to read tight vs loose markets, link vacancy with rents/listings/DOM, and translate signals into actions.

## Market Context
- Nationally, vacancy has been low in many corridors through 2025, but conditions vary suburb‑to‑suburb. Always validate at micro‑location level (PropTrack, 2025).
- Where building approvals and completions remain subdued relative to demand, tight vacancy tends to persist; where new stock delivers in bulk, vacancy can loosen (ABS Building Approvals 8731.0, 2024–2025).

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: A direct read on tenant competition and leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Reinforces the vacancy read; strong rent growth often accompanies sustained low vacancy.
- Listings & DOM: For sale activity shapes investor supply and can pre‑signal loosening/tightening.
- Supply pipeline: Approvals and completions determine how long tight (or loose) conditions can last.
- Stock mix: New‑build/unit‑heavy pockets behave differently to established house‑dominant areas.

## What the Data Shows
- Tight markets (very low vacancy) typically achieve quicker leasing and stronger rent review outcomes. Price effects depend on buyer depth (listings/DOM) and borrowing costs.
- Looser markets require sharper pricing, better presentation and realistic rent settings to minimise time vacant; headline yields can slip if rent momentum stalls.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | (12/2025)             | ↘/→       | Direct read on tenant demand and leasing risk. |
| Rents (YoY)         | (2025)                | ↗/→       | Confirms pressure where vacancy is tight. |
| Listings (YoY)      | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Scarcity supports pricing power; rising stock can ease pressure. |
| DOM                 | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Faster leasing indicates stronger depth of demand. |
| Building approvals  | (2025)                | ↘         | Slower pipelines extend tight rental conditions. |
| Investor lending    | (2025)                | →         | Participation shifts affect investor supply response. |

Interpretation
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent‑review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 indicators in agreement.

## Reading Vacancy Correctly
- Definitions: Vacancy is the share of rental stock unlet at a point in time. Sources differ in coverage (PM portfolios vs listing‑based estimates). Compare like‑for‑like over time from the same source.
- Thresholds (guidelines, not rules):
  - Very tight: ~0–1% → strong leasing, frequent rent reviews.
  - Tight to balanced: ~1–2% → stable leasing; outcomes vary by stock quality.
  - Loose: >3% → more days vacant; price and presentation matter.
- Always combine with rent momentum and enquiry quality from leasing agents. Vacancy without rent/inspection context can mislead.

## How to Pull the Data Yourself
- Vacancy & rents: PropTrack Insights (monthly market commentary and suburb/city trends). Save the month/year and keep a local log for your target suburbs.
- Approvals: ABS 8731.0 Building Approvals (dwellings total) — state and dwelling type. Track 12‑month totals to smooth volatility.
- Listings & DOM: CoreLogic/PropTrack city and region updates. Focus on YoY direction and the last 1–3 prints for confirmation.
- Rates backdrop: RBA Cash Rate Target (statistics page). Use month+year in any citation.

## State & City Patterns (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner/middle rings with constrained new supply often sustain low vacancy; outer rings vary with delivery schedules and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Mixed conditions — check approvals vs completions and on‑the‑ground leasing feedback in each corridor.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported low vacancy across multiple hubs; watch pipeline delivery around growth corridors.
- SA/WA/NT: Prolonged tight vacancy pockets have underpinned rent resilience; confirm micro‑location constraints and employer demand.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation. Monitor implementation dates and compliance costs.
- Supply shocks: Catch‑up in approvals/completions can ease vacancy; track ABS approvals and local development updates.
- Migration & Employment: Changes in flows and labour markets alter rental pressure — especially in uni/health/industry hubs.
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change investor participation; watch RBA decisions and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Build a simple log: vacancy, rent YoY, listings YoY, DOM — monthly.
- Shortlist 3 suburbs with consistently tight vacancy; verify with property managers before offers.
- Inspect 3–5 comparables and call 2 local PMs for real enquiry/turnover context.

### For Experienced Investors
- Automate alerts: vacancy moves, listings and DOM direction for target corridors.
- Prioritise micro‑locations with structural constraints (schools, transport, employment nodes) and proven leasing depth.
- Stress‑test rent assumptions (−5%) and hold buffers (≥6–12 months) before bids.

## Key Takeaways
- Vacancy is a leading, high‑signal input — but only when read with rents, listings and supply.
- Focus on suburb‑level conditions and leasing feedback, not just city medians.
- Tight markets reward preparation and quality assets; loose markets require sharper pricing and buffers.
