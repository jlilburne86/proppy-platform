# Case Study: First‑Time Buyer in Regional QLD

> Summary: A grounded walkthrough of a first purchase in a regional QLD town under rental pressure, emphasising buffers, quality, and clarity.

## Key Takeaways
- Preparation beats speed: tight brief + pre‑approval + short list of 3.
- Quality and livability trump cheap headline yields.
- Buy buffer‑safe; price risk for flood/noise/insurance exposure.

## Plan
1) Define objective (stabiliser vs accelerator); set budget and buffer.
2) Build a micro‑dashboard (vacancy, rents, listings, DOM).
3) Walk the stock; reject compromised locations and poor layouts early.

## Execution
- Offer based on evidence: comparable sales and current rent letters.
- Building & pest; insurance quotes; PM opinion on days‑to‑lease.
- Post‑settlement checklist: safety, minor cosmetic refresh, rent review timing.

## Risks & Lessons
- Insurance costs can bite; price them before exchange.
- Don’t chase marginal areas for “extra yield”; choose durable demand.
