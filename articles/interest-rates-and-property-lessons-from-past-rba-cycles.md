# Interest Rates and Property: Lessons from Past RBA Cycles

Rates shape serviceability, borrowing psychology and pricing — but never in a straight line. This guide distils the useful lessons from prior RBA cycles and sets a planning framework that doesn’t rely on perfect forecasts.

## Market Context
- Lending standards and assessment rates govern borrowing power more than headline cash rates alone. Rent dynamics, supply and sentiment mediate how rate changes pass through to prices.

## Key Drivers
- Funding costs and bank margins; assessment rate buffers; wage growth; rental pressure; and parallel shifts in other asset classes that affect investor flows.

## What the Data Shows
- The lag between rate moves and price/rent moves varies across cities.  
- Investor activity tends to recover first in markets with strong rental fundamentals and constrained supply.  
- Over multi‑year windows, quality assets in supply‑limited areas outlast rate cycles.

## Expert Insight
- Plan for ranges, not points. Scenarios should test your cashflow and buffers — not your ability to guess central banks.

## Investor Lens
- Beginners: build a cash buffer sized for today’s rates and +1.5% stress; avoid thin‑yield assets that force decisions.  
- Experienced: stage acquisitions; if markets are mixed, add where fundamentals are strongest and your cashflow remains resilient.

## Risks & Considerations
- Forecast error; whipsaw from rapid policy shifts; mis‑timed fixed/variable decisions.

## Practical Planning Checklist

- Two‑rate cashflow (today and +1.5%); check at portfolio level.  
- Re‑underwrite target markets quarterly; don’t rely on last year’s assumptions.  
- Match rate structures to your risk tolerance; keep optionality where possible.  
- Prioritise quality assets that rent fast and attract deep buyer pools later.

## Key Takeaways
- Rates matter, but fundamentals and discipline matter more. Use scenarios, not predictions, to guide action windows.

### Additional Perspective
When signals conflict, slow down and expand observation. Extend the monitoring window by a quarter, validate rent movements with on‑the‑ground leasing feedback, and compare against a neighbouring suburb with a different stock mix. If the signal persists across multiple indicators and timeframes, it deserves more weight; if it fades, file it under noise.

Policy and lending settings shape investor behaviour in ways that can be hard to model. That is why the playbook emphasises resilience: buffers, quality assets, diversified exposure, and decisions that don’t depend on predicting the next move. In practice, that means pre‑agreeing what data would cause you to act — and what would cause you to wait.
