# Yield vs Capital Growth: Finding the Balance

Growth compounds equity; yield funds holding. This article shows how to trade off the two based on cycle position, borrowing capacity, and risk tolerance using vacancy, rents, listings, DOM and supply—then turns it into investor actions.

## Market Context
- Monetary settings eased from 2024 peaks. The RBA cash rate target was 3.60% in Dec 2025 after reductions earlier that year (RBA, 10 Dec 2025).
- Dwelling approvals remained well below 2021 peaks through 2024–2025 in many states, constraining medium‑term supply where demand persists (ABS, 2024–2025).
- Rental markets across several corridors stayed tight, supporting yields even where prices moved sideways (PropTrack, 2025).

## Key Drivers
- Vacancy: Lower vacancy supports rent growth and reduces leasing risk.
- Rent momentum: Sustained rent increases improve gross yield and buffers.
- Listings & DOM: Scarcer listings and falling DOM can confirm buyer depth.
- Supply pipeline: Completions vs approvals inform medium‑term rental pressure.
- Borrowing costs: Assessment rates shape buyer depth and turnover.
- Stock mix: Houses vs units, and micro‑location livability, drive dispersion.

## What the Data Shows
- Long‑run (10–20y): Compounding and holding quality assets through cycles dominate outcomes (CoreLogic long‑run indexes).
- 12–24m: Some corridors show strong rent growth with modest price gains; others the reverse (PropTrack/CoreLogic, 2024–2025). Treat city medians as context only—suburb‑level signals matter most.
- Last 1–3 quarters: Listings, vacancy, and approvals provide near‑term signal; confirm across multiple prints to avoid noise.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens
| Signal              | Recent Read (mm/yyyy) | Direction | Why it matters |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vacancy             | (12/2025)             | ↘/→       | Tight vacancy supports yields and leasing certainty. |
| Rents (YoY)         | (2025)                | ↗/→       | Rent growth boosts gross yield and buffers. |
| Listings (YoY)      | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Scarcity can support prices; rising stock can loosen conditions. |
| DOM                 | (Q4/2025)             | ↘/→       | Faster sales often signal stronger buyer depth. |
| Building approvals  | (2025)                | ↘         | Lower approvals today can mean tighter future rentals. |
| Investor lending    | (2025)                | →         | Participation shifts influence competition and timing. |

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation; monitor implementation timing and compliance costs.
- Supply shifts: Catch‑up in approvals/completions can temper rents; track ABS approvals and local pipeline updates.
- Migration & Employment: Changes in interstate/overseas flows and labour markets alter rental pressure (ABS/RBA updates).
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change buyer depth; track RBA decisions and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Define a 6‑metric dashboard; refresh monthly.
- Shortlist 3 suburbs that meet yield or growth criteria; run standard DD (zoning, overlays, stock quality).
- Timebox research (e.g., 2 weeks), then inspect and decide.

### For Experienced Investors
- Standardise cross‑state DD; set alerts for key signals.
- Run sensitivity (rent −5% / interest +1.5%) before offers.
- Sequence portfolio: Add a yield stabiliser if buffers are thin; lean into growth when signals align.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
