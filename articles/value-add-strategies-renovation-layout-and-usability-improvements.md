# Value‑Add Strategies: Renovation, Layout and Usability Improvements

Not every upgrade pays — the best value‑adds improve rentability, function and buyer appeal without overcapitalising. This guide prioritises layout fixes, usability and presentation, with simple ways to think about cost vs benefit.

## What Matters (Not Market Noise)
- Focus upgrades on frictions that block tenants/buyers: poor light, lack of storage, dysfunctional flow, tired wet areas, noise/thermal issues.
- Start with rentability: target changes that shorten leasing time and reduce vacancy, then consider sale appeal.

Examples to verify and cite:
- Vacancy remained low in several markets through late 2025–early 2026, with sub‑1% periods in some corridors [CHECK: PropTrack/Domain vacancy, mm/yyyy, city/suburb].
- New dwelling approvals eased from 2021 peaks before stabilising in 2024–2025, varying by state [CHECK: ABS 8731.0, mm/yyyy, NSW/VIC/QLD lines].

## High‑Impact, Low‑Complexity Plays
- Layout improvements: add wardrobes; convert dead space to study nook; improve bedroom door swing and circulation.
- Light & ventilation: brighter globes, sheers + blockouts, remove heavy window dressings, add exhausts where missing.
- Kitchen/bath refresh: new handles, tapware, re‑silicone/re‑grout; replace benchtops and vanity where warranted.
- Storage & usability: add linen/pantry modules; hooks/shelving at entries; bike storage.
- Noise/thermal comfort: seals, door closers, basic acoustic rugs/underlays.

## Practical Cost/Benefit Thinking (Illustrative)
- Target upgrades with measurable rentability impact (faster leasing, fewer objections) rather than speculative value.
- Use a simple hurdle: aim for payback within 12–24 months on small items; insist on strong evidence for larger works.
- Validate with your PM: list objections from the last campaign; fix the top 3 if cost‑effective.

## 🔍 Proppy Checklist
- Gather PM feedback from last leasing/sale campaign.
- List top 3 objections; map each to a low‑complexity fix.
- Price parts/labour; sanity‑check payback period.
- Stage works to minimise vacancy days; re‑list with better media/presentation.

Interpretation:
- Yield‑tilted: Vacancy low + rents rising + flat prices → prioritise resilient cashflow assets with rent review scope.
- Growth‑tilted: Falling DOM + tighter listings + stable borrowing costs → target quality assets in constrained micro‑locations.
- Mixed: Extend observation to the next print; seek 2–3 signals in agreement.

## Methodology & Criteria
- Dashboard (monthly/quarterly): Vacancy, rent YoY/QoQ, listings YoY, DOM, approvals, investor lending.
- Qualitative overlay: Micro‑location (arterials/noise/flood), stock quality (layout, light, maintenance), body corporate/land size.
- Guideline thresholds: “Vacancy < ~1.5% with rising rents” strengthens yield case; “DOM falling and listings tightening” strengthens growth case.

Worked examples
- Gross yield = annual rent / price. Example: $560/wk → $29,120/yr on $620,000 → 4.7% gross.
- Cashflow buffer (pre‑tax) = annual rent − interest − insurance − rates − maintenance − PM fees. Stress test at +100–150 bps.
- Equity sensitivity (illustrative): +6% on $620,000 → +$37,200 paper equity; compare to cashflow outcome.

## State Highlights (Qualitative)
- NSW/ACT: Inner‑ring scarcity dynamics; some middle‑ring units improve on yield where vacancy stays tight; outer‑ring depends on new‑build delivery and commute realities.
- VIC/TAS: Monitor approvals vs completions and rental pressure in growth corridors; inner/middle rings bifurcate by stock quality.
- QLD: SEQ demand has supported rents; watch corridor‑specific vacancy and listings when choosing between house yield plays vs inner‑unit recovery stories.
- SA/WA/NT: Tight vacancy in parts of SA/WA supported rent growth; confirm micro‑location and pipeline to avoid overpaying for transient yield.

## Risks & What to Watch Next
- Policy & Tenancy: State‑level rental rule changes and short‑stay regulation [CHECK source/date]; watch compliance costs.
- Supply Shocks: Catch‑up in approvals/completions can temper rents; track ABS approvals monthly.
- Migration & Employment: Shifts in interstate/overseas flows and labour markets alter rental pressure [CHECK: ABS/RBA].
- Cost & Rates: Funding costs and assessment rates change buyer depth; monitor RBA statements and lender pricing.

## Investor Actions
### For Newer Investors
- Do the basics: paint, lights, handles, sheers, deep clean, garden trim.
- Fix function first (storage, flow), then looks.
- Ask your PM to price a leasing‑ready scope and timeline.

### For Experienced Investors
- Systematise make‑readies across assets (templates, preferred trades, parts lists).
- Batch upgrades to reduce call‑outs/travel; calendar them between lease cycles.
- Track campaign metrics (days to let, enquiry, objections) and iterate.

## Key Takeaways
- Let multi‑signal confirmation guide timing; avoid single‑metric bets.
- Balance current cashflow with future equity based on buffers and goals.
- Prefer quality assets in constrained micro‑locations; hold through cycles.
