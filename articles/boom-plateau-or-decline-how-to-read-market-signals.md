# Boom, Plateau, or Decline: How to Read Market Signals

> Summary: A repeatable way to read multi‑signal data so you can tell when a market is accelerating (boom), levelling off (plateau), or softening (decline) — and act with confidence.

## Key Takeaways
- Don’t act on a single metric; use at least 3 signals in agreement.
- Tight vacancy plus rising rents often underpins yields through a plateau.
- Falling DOM with flat listings is a constructive growth read — if quality stock is scarce.
- Confirm trends over 2–3 data prints; volatility can create head‑fakes.

## Market Context
Markets rarely move in straight lines. Borrowing costs, migration, and delivery of new housing all nudge demand and supply. A clear read needs a small dashboard you can check monthly or quarterly — then a consistent way to turn the read into actions: buy, hold, improve, or wait.

## Data Snapshot (Proppy)
- Vacancy: [FILL: %] • Rents (YoY): [FILL: %] • Listings (YoY): [FILL: %] • DOM: [FILL: days]
- Gross yield: [FILL: %] • Price 3y/5y/10y: [FILL]
Note: Pull from `data/proppydata.json` for your target LGA/suburb; prefer the latest month/quarter.

## What the Data Shows
Signals to combine:
- Vacancy: Sub‑~1.5% tight. Rising vacancy can foreshadow softer rents and longer leasing times.
- Rents (YoY/QoQ): Sustained rent growth supports yield and buffers. Stall = watch vacancy and [approvals](supply-constraints-construction-delays.html).
- Listings (YoY) and DOM: Fewer listings and falling DOM indicate stronger buyer depth; the reverse warns of softening.
- Pipeline (approvals/completions): Low approvals today can point to tighter rentals 12–24 months ahead.
- Investor lending: Rising participation can sharpen competition; falling can ease it.

How to read regimes:
- Boom: vacancy tight, rents rising, listings flat/down, DOM falling → growth case improves; confirm stock quality.
- Plateau: vacancy tight, rents up, listings stable, DOM flat → hold quality assets; improve cashflow (reviews & maintenance).
- Decline: vacancy rising, rents stale, listings up, DOM rising → be selective, price risk, prioritise buffers.

## Investor Actions
### Newer Investors
- Build a 6‑metric dashboard; save screenshots each month for your short‑list areas.
- If 3+ signals line up constructively, timebox inspections (e.g., 2 weeks) and move decisively on quality stock.
- If mixed/unclear, extend observation one or two prints and keep building cash + pre‑approval readiness.

### Experienced Investors
- Run a two‑bucket playbook: stabiliser (yield‑tilted) vs accelerator (growth‑tilted). Buy the one your portfolio needs.
- Stress test buffers at +100–150 bps interest; require “buffer‑safe” deals before offers.
- If adding yield, target low‑vacancy micro‑locations with demonstrable rental pressure (days‑to‑lease, rent reviews). If adding growth, insist on quality, scarcity, and liveability.

## Risks & What to Watch
- Policy & Tenancy: Rule changes can affect holding costs and tenant demand; track state updates.
- Supply Surprises: A jump in approvals/completions can cool rents; keep an eye on ABS series.
- Macro: RBA path and labour markets sway buyer depth; avoid over‑reliance on any one path.

## Methodology
- Multi‑signal confirmation across vacancy, rents, listings, DOM, pipeline, and lending.
- Validate at suburb and stock level; don’t pay A‑grade prices for B‑grade assets.
