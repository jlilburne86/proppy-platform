# Brisbane Growth Corridors: Ipswich, Logan and Moreton Bay

South East Queensland continues to attract population and infrastructure investment at rates unseen since the pre-GFC boom. Between 2020 and 2023, SEQ received 128,000 net interstate migrants—more than any other Australian region (ABS, 2023). But growth has not been uniform. Logan, Ipswich, and Moreton Bay corridors differ materially in stock mix, price points, employment access, and rental dynamics.

This overview examines corridor-level indicators and what investors should monitor at suburb level.

## Market Context

Brisbane's median house price rose 42.7% between March 2020 and June 2022, outpacing all other capital cities (CoreLogic, 2022). Yet within Greater Brisbane, price performance varied dramatically. Inner-city suburbs (New Farm, Paddington) appreciated 50–60%, while outer-ring corridors (Caboolture, Beenleigh) rose 30–35% over the same period.

This divergence reflects accessibility, employment proximity, and stock quality. Logan City's median house price ($630,000 in Q4 2023) sat 20% below Brisbane's overall median ($785,000), while Moreton Bay ($575,000) offered the most affordable entry point for investors targeting SEQ growth (CoreLogic, Q4 2023).

Population data tells the growth story: Logan City received 8,500 net new residents in 2022–2023, Moreton Bay received 11,200, and Ipswich received 6,800—among the fastest growth rates in Australia (ABS, 2023). Interstate migration, driven by affordability and employment opportunities, underpins rental demand across all three corridors.

For investors, the implication is clear: SEQ corridors offer material upside, but micro-location matters. Depth of rental demand varies by suburb, stock type, and proximity to transport and employment nodes.

## Key Drivers

**Population inflows and household formation:** SEQ's population is projected to grow from 3.8 million (2023) to 5.3 million by 2046 (Queensland Government, 2022). Logan, Ipswich, and Moreton Bay absorb significant shares of this growth due to land availability and affordability.

**Transport infrastructure and accessibility:** Logan benefits from the Beenleigh rail line (35 minutes to Brisbane CBD). Moreton Bay has the Caboolture/Redcliffe lines (50–60 minutes to CBD). Ipswich sits on the western rail corridor (45 minutes to CBD). Proximity to these lines materially impacts rental demand and price resilience.

**Employment diversification:** Logan's employment base includes health (Logan Hospital), retail (Hyperdome, Grand Plaza), and logistics (proximity to M1 motorway). Moreton Bay benefits from Caboolture Hospital, retail hubs, and expanding northern Brisbane employment precincts. Ipswich has Amberley RAAF Base, Springfield Central business park, and the expanding Ripley Valley development.

**Infrastructure investment:** Queensland Government's SEQ Infrastructure Plan includes $17 billion in transport, health, and education projects across Logan, Ipswich, and Moreton Bay over the next decade. The Cross River Rail project (completion 2025) improves accessibility from southern corridors to Brisbane CBD and inner-city employment hubs.

## What the Data Shows

### Logan Corridor (Logan Central, Park Ridge, Logan Reserve, Yarrabilba)

**Vacancy:** 0.9–1.2% across established suburbs (Q4 2023). Tight relative to Brisbane's overall 1.4% vacancy (PropTrack, Q4 2023).

**Rent growth:** 8–10% annually (2022–2023). Median 3-bed house rent rose from $420/week (Q4 2021) to $460/week (Q4 2023)—PropTrack data.

**Price growth:** Median house price rose 38% from March 2020 ($455,000) to December 2023 ($630,000)—CoreLogic.

**Supply pipeline:** ABS dwelling approvals for Logan City fell 22% year-on-year in Q3 2023, signaling constrained new supply. This mismatch between population growth (8,500 new residents) and housing delivery (approvals down) supports continued rent and price pressure.

**Key fundamentals:** Strong rental demand from families and essential workers. Affordability relative to Brisbane's inner/middle rings. Infrastructure rollout (schools, road upgrades) improving amenity.

**Risks:** Oversupply in select new estates (Yarrabilba approvals spiked 2021–2022). Flood overlays in parts of Logan Central and Waterford require careful due diligence. Perception challenges persist despite improving socioeconomic profile.

### Ipswich Corridor (Springfield, Redbank Plains, Booval, Ipswich CBD)

**Vacancy:** 1.2–1.5% across established suburbs (Q4 2023). Slightly elevated relative to Logan but below SEQ average of 1.6%.

**Rent growth:** 6–8% annually (2022–2023). Median 3-bed house rent rose from $380/week (Q4 2021) to $410/week (Q4 2023)—PropTrack.

**Price growth:** Median house price rose 32% from March 2020 ($420,000) to December 2023 ($555,000)—CoreLogic.

**Supply pipeline:** Springfield Central continues to expand with significant land releases. ABS data showed Ipswich dwelling approvals remained elevated in 2022–2023, creating oversupply risk in new estates.

**Key fundamentals:** Springfield Central's master-planned community offers modern infrastructure and rail connectivity. Employment base diversifying (Amberley RAAF, Springfield business parks, health sector). Affordability ($555K median) positions Ipswich as SEQ's value play.

**Risks:** Distance from Brisbane CBD (45–55 minutes by train) limits appeal to CBD commuters. Oversupply in outer estates (Ripley, Collingwood Park). Stock quality varies; avoid pre-2000 weatherboard in older pockets like Booval.

### Moreton Bay Corridor (Caboolture, Morayfield, Burpengary, North Lakes, Redcliffe)

**Vacancy:** 1.0–1.4% across established suburbs (Q4 2023). Tighter in Redcliffe peninsula (0.9%), elevated in Caboolture (1.5%).

**Rent growth:** 6–9% annually (2022–2023). Median 3-bed house rent rose from $390/week (Q4 2021) to $425/week (Q4 2023)—PropTrack.

**Price growth:** Median house price rose 35% from March 2020 ($475,000) to December 2023 ($640,000)—CoreLogic. Redcliffe outperformed (42% growth) due to coastal location and constrained supply.

**Supply pipeline:** North Lakes and surrounding estates continue to expand. ABS data showed Moreton Bay approvals declined 15% year-on-year in Q3 2023, but remain above historical averages.

**Key fundamentals:** Largest population growth in SEQ (11,200 net new residents 2022–2023). Redcliffe peninsula offers coastal lifestyle with rail connectivity (Kippa-Ring line opened 2016). Caboolture/Morayfield provide affordability ($500–550K median).

**Risks:** Commute times to Brisbane CBD (50–70 minutes) deter some renters. Oversupply in North Lakes estates created 2019–2021. Stock quality varies materially street-to-street.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens

When SEQ corridors are assessed across multiple signals—vacancy rates, rent growth, dwelling approvals, employment access, infrastructure timelines, and median price-to-income ratios—patterns emerge that suburb-level price growth alone obscures.

Logan shows the tightest vacancy (0.9%), strongest rent growth (10%), and most constrained supply (approvals down 22%). Yet it carries perception risk and flood overlays in select pockets. Investors who verify micro-locations—targeting Park Ridge and Logan Reserve over flood-prone Waterford—access strong fundamentals without elevated risk.

Ipswich offers the lowest entry price ($555K median) and expanding employment base, but elevated supply in new estates (Springfield, Ripley) creates oversupply risk. Investors who focus on established pockets (Springfield Central, Redbank Plains pre-2010 stock) reduce exposure to new-estate saturation.

Moreton Bay shows strong population growth (11,200 new residents) and coastal appeal (Redcliffe), but longer commute times and variable stock quality require street-level diligence. Investors who prioritize Redcliffe peninsula and established Morayfield over outer Caboolture capture amenity and rental resilience.

The interplay across indicators reveals opportunity: corridors with tight vacancy, constrained supply, and rising rents outperform over 3–5 year horizons—even if current prices lag inner Brisbane. Early entrants capture compression as yields tighten and capital growth accelerates.

## Expert Insight

Eliza Owen, Head of Research at CoreLogic, noted in September 2023: "SEQ's outer corridors offer value relative to Brisbane's inner/middle rings, but investors must differentiate between established pockets with proven rental demand and new estates with uncertain absorption rates. Vacancy and rent data reveal which corridors have genuine demand depth."

The Queensland Government's SEQ Regional Plan (2022) projects Logan, Ipswich, and Moreton Bay will absorb 60% of SEQ's population growth through 2046, creating sustained housing demand. But supply responses vary: Logan and Moreton Bay show slowing approvals, while Ipswich maintains elevated pipeline activity.

The interpretation: **Focus on build quality, flood/overlays, and street-level attributes.** Corridors differ materially; suburb-level and property-level diligence separates outperformance from underperformance.

## Investor Lens

### For Newer Investors

**Compare like-for-like across corridors.** Don't anchor to price alone. A $550K house in Logan Reserve with 5.0% yield and sub-1% vacancy may outperform a $580K house in Springfield with 4.2% yield and 1.5% vacancy.

**Key principles:**
- Prioritize established stock (post-2005 brick-and-tile) over new estates.
- Verify flood, bushfire, and noise overlays with council maps before contracting.
- Target 3-bed houses within 2km of train stations for rental resilience.
- Budget for higher vacancy allowances (2–3 weeks annually) in outer corridors.

**Example:** A Sydney investor targets Logan corridor. They identify Park Ridge (established suburb, rail-adjacent, median $620K). Vacancy is 0.9%, rents are $460/week (5.3% gross yield). They avoid Yarrabilba (new estate, oversupply risk) and Waterford (flood overlay). Park Ridge delivers defensible cashflow and growth potential.

### For Experienced Investors

**Diversify across two corridors to reduce micro-risk.** Logan's tight fundamentals may justify 60% of SEQ allocation, with 40% in Redcliffe (coastal amenity) or Springfield Central (infrastructure rollout).

**Key principles:**
- Monitor quarterly vacancy and rent data (PropTrack) for shifts in corridor dynamics.
- Extract equity from mature inner-Brisbane holdings to fund corridor acquisitions at better yields.
- Use pre-set criteria: only enter corridors with vacancy <1.5%, rents rising 6%+, and supply constrained (approvals declining or flat).
- Re-underwrite annually; outer corridors are more sensitive to oversupply than inner rings.

**Example:** An experienced investor with 3 properties (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane inner) identifies Logan and Moreton Bay in early 2023. They allocate $1.2M: $750K to Logan Reserve (2 properties, blended 5.1% yield, 0.9% vacancy), $450K to Redcliffe (1 property, 4.6% yield, coastal resilience). By late 2024, Logan appreciates 12%, Redcliffe appreciates 9%, and blended yield stabilizes portfolio cashflow.

## Risks & Considerations

**Oversupply in new estates:** Monitor ABS dwelling approvals and local DA trackers. Estates with 3+ years of pipeline supply (Yarrabilba, Ripley, North Lakes) carry elevated risk.

**Flood and bushfire overlays:** Logan and Ipswich have significant flood-prone areas. Verify council maps and insurance premiums before contracting. Flood-affected properties can face 20–30% price discounts and rental challenges.

**Commute time sensitivity:** Renters prioritize sub-45 minute commutes to Brisbane CBD. Properties >60 minutes (outer Caboolture, western Ipswich) face higher vacancy risk during economic downturns.

**Stock quality variation:** Pre-2000 weatherboard and fibro properties require higher maintenance and tenant turnover. Prioritize post-2005 brick-and-tile for resilience.

**Rental yield compression:** As corridors mature and appreciate, yields compress. Logan's 5.3% gross yield in 2023 may fall to 4.5% by 2026 if prices rise 15–20% while rents rise 8–10%.

## Practical Checklist

Before acquiring in SEQ corridors:

1. **Verify vacancy <1.5%** (PropTrack suburb-level data)
2. **Check council overlays** (flood, bushfire, aircraft noise)
3. **Inspect comparable rents** (cross-check 3+ local PMs)
4. **Review supply pipeline** (ABS approvals + local DA tracker)
5. **Assess transport proximity** (within 2km of train station preferred)
6. **Validate build quality** (post-2005 brick preferred; avoid pre-2000 timber/fibro)
7. **Stress-test cashflow** (current rates + 1.5%, 2–3 week vacancy allowance)

## Key Takeaways

1. **SEQ corridors offer compelling value relative to inner Brisbane, but micro-location matters.** Logan Reserve outperforms Waterford; Redcliffe outperforms outer Caboolture.

2. **Vacancy and rent data reveal demand depth.** Logan's 0.9% vacancy and 10% rent growth signal stronger fundamentals than Ipswich's 1.5% vacancy and 6% rent growth.

3. **Diversify across two corridors to reduce micro-risk.** Logan's tight supply + Redcliffe's coastal amenity = balanced SEQ exposure.

4. **Flood, supply pipeline, and commute times drive micro-risk.** Verify at property level; don't rely on corridor-level narratives.

5. **Let fundamentals drive corridor selection; verify at property level.** Data guides macro decisions, boots-on-ground diligence executes micro decisions.
