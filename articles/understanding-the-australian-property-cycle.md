# Understanding the Australian Property Cycle

Cycles don't repeat perfectly, but they rhyme. Australian residential property moves through recognizable phases shaped by credit conditions, supply pipelines, employment trends, and investor sentiment. Understanding these phases—and the indicators that signal transitions—helps investors make decisions with confidence, not guesswork.

This guide explains the typical phases of the Australian property cycle and the data points that matter most at each stage.

## Market Context

Australian property cycles operate across multiple timeframes and rarely move in unison across cities or regions. Between 2012 and 2017, Sydney's median house price rose 73%, while Perth fell 9% over the same period (CoreLogic, 2012–2017). These divergences reflect local employment trends, migration patterns, and supply responses unique to each market.

Over the past three decades, Australian capital city cycles have averaged 7–10 years trough-to-trough, though no two cycles are identical. The 2020–2023 cycle compressed a typical 5-year expansion into 18 months, driven by record-low rates (0.10% cash rate in May 2020) and pandemic-era fiscal stimulus. By November 2023, the RBA cash rate sat at 4.35%, and national dwelling values had corrected 8.6% from their April 2022 peak (CoreLogic, November 2023).

Regional and city cycles often run at different speeds. While capital cities entered correction in mid-2022, select regional markets continued rising into early 2023 before following suit. This lag reflects differing sensitivities to interest rates, migration flows, and local supply constraints.

For investors, the implication is clear: national headlines can obscure suburb-level opportunity and risk. Cycle awareness requires zooming into specific markets and tracking leading indicators that precede price movements by 6–12 months.

## Key Drivers

Several forces shape cycle dynamics across Australian markets:

**Credit conditions and serviceability:** Interest rate settings determine borrowing capacity and investor cashflow. The 2022–2023 rate hiking cycle (0.10% to 4.35% in 18 months) reduced borrowing capacity by approximately 30% for median-income households, directly impacting demand.

**Supply pipeline and construction activity:** ABS dwelling approval data leads price movements. When approvals fall and completions slow, constrained supply underpins price resilience. Conversely, oversupply—especially in apartment corridors—can delay recovery by years. Brisbane's CBD apartment market took 7 years (2010–2017) to absorb excess supply from the pre-GFC construction boom.

**Labour market and migration:** Employment growth and interstate/overseas migration drive rental demand and household formation. Net overseas migration to Australia surged to 518,000 in the year to June 2023 (ABS), compressing vacancy rates and accelerating rents in key arrival cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane).

**Investor sentiment and confidence:** Auctions clearance rates, vendor discounting, and days-on-market reflect buyer/seller psychology. When clearance rates fall below 55–60%, sentiment typically shifts from optimism to caution, signaling cycle softening.

## Typical Cycle Phases

While no cycle repeats perfectly, four recognizable phases emerge:

### Phase 1: Recovery

**Characteristics:** Prices stabilize after correction. Vacancy falls. Rents begin rising. Listings remain elevated but start declining. Days-on-market shorten.

**Indicators to monitor:**
- Vacancy rates moving below 2.5% and trending down
- Rental growth turning positive (1–3% annually)
- Auction clearance rates stabilizing above 55%
- Dwelling approvals bottoming out

**Recent example:** Sydney mid-2023 to early 2024. After an 8-month correction, vacancy compressed to 1.8%, rents rose 6.2% year-on-year, and auction clearance rates stabilized near 60% (PropTrack, March 2024).

**Investor approach:** Recovery phases reward patient capital. Early entrants secure better pricing and yields before momentum builds. Focus on fundamentals: vacancy, rent growth, and supply constraints.

### Phase 2: Expansion

**Characteristics:** Prices rise consistently. Vacancy tightens further (sub-2%). Rents accelerate. Buyer activity increases. Listings fall. Clearance rates exceed 65–70%. Confidence builds.

**Indicators to monitor:**
- Vacancy sub-1.5% with rental growth 5–8% annually
- Median price growth 6–12% p.a.
- Days-on-market shortening (median DOM below 30 days)
- Auction clearance rates above 70%
- New dwelling approvals rising (supply response beginning)

**Recent example:** Brisbane 2020–2022. Median house prices rose 42.7% over 30 months, driven by interstate migration, sub-1% vacancy, and constrained supply. Clearance rates peaked above 80% in early 2022 (CoreLogic, 2020–2022).

**Investor approach:** Expansion phases favor growth-oriented acquisitions in supply-constrained markets. Yield may compress, but capital appreciation accelerates. Ensure buffers can handle rising rates if cycle timing shifts.

### Phase 3: Peak / Slowdown

**Characteristics:** Price growth decelerates. Supply increases (new approvals and listings rise). Affordability constraints emerge. Clearance rates soften. Buyer urgency fades. Vendor expectations lag market reality.

**Indicators to monitor:**
- Clearance rates falling below 65%
- Listings rising, DOM lengthening
- Price growth decelerating (e.g., from 10% p.a. to 3–5% p.a.)
- New dwelling approvals elevated (supply pipeline growing)
- Discounting increasing (difference between list and sale prices widening)

**Recent example:** Sydney late 2021 to early 2022. After 18 months of rapid growth, clearance rates fell from 80% to 65%, listings rose 12%, and median price growth decelerated from 3% per quarter to 0.5%. By April 2022, the market had peaked (CoreLogic, 2022).

**Investor approach:** Slowdown phases require caution. Avoid overpaying in weakening markets. Focus on high-quality assets in resilient corridors. Consider pausing acquisitions if signals point to imminent correction.

### Phase 4: Correction / Downturn

**Characteristics:** Prices fall. Listings accumulate. Clearance rates drop below 55%. Days-on-market lengthen. Forced sales increase. Rental demand may hold (vacancy rising slower than price decline), but rents flatten or soften.

**Indicators to monitor:**
- Clearance rates sustained below 50%
- Median price declines 5–15% from peak
- Listings elevated, DOM above 40–50 days
- Vendor discounting widespread (10–15% below initial list prices common)
- Auction pass-in rates above 40%

**Recent example:** Melbourne 2022–2023. From peak (February 2022) to trough (February 2023), median dwelling values fell 8.4%. Clearance rates dropped to 48%, listings rose 18%, and DOM extended to 42 days (CoreLogic, 2023).

**Investor approach:** Corrections test conviction. Avoid panic selling quality assets. For buyers with buffers, corrections offer entry points—but timing the bottom is difficult. Focus on fundamentals: markets with defensible employment, constrained supply, and rental resilience recover faster.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens

When markets are assessed across multiple signals—including vacancy trends, rental growth, days-on-market, auction clearance rates, vendor discounting, supply pipelines, and employment data—patterns emerge that single indicators miss.

A suburb may show rising prices, but if clearance rates are softening, listings are building, and new dwelling approvals are spiking, those price gains may not be durable. Conversely, a market with flat prices, sub-1% vacancy, accelerating rents, and constrained supply often signals a recovery or early expansion phase—prices lag rent and vacancy movements by 6–12 months.

The interplay across indicators matters more than any single metric. Strong clearance rates with rising listings suggest temporary strength; falling clearance rates with falling listings suggest stabilization. Rent growth without price growth indicates undersupply—growth typically follows. Price growth without rent growth signals speculative momentum—vulnerability follows.

Long-term data shows that the highest-performing investors don't try to time exact cycle turns. They use pre-set decision bands:

- **Expansion confirmed:** vacancy < 1.5%, rents rising 5%+, clearance > 70%, DOM shortening → add growth-oriented assets.
- **Slowdown emerging:** clearance falling below 65%, listings rising, DOM lengthening → pause or focus on defensive quality.
- **Correction deepening:** clearance < 50%, prices falling, discounting widespread → hold cash, wait for stabilization signals.
- **Recovery forming:** vacancy falling, rents rising, clearance stabilizing > 55%, listings declining → begin selective acquisitions.

These bands remove emotion and anchor decisions to observable data, not gut feel or headlines.

## Expert Insight

Tim Lawless, Research Director at CoreLogic, noted in November 2023: "The Australian property cycle is influenced by both national factors—monetary policy, credit availability—and highly localized factors like employment concentration, supply constraints, and infrastructure investment. Investors who ignore local fundamentals in favor of national narratives often mistime their entries and exits."

The RBA's May 2023 Financial Stability Review reinforced this: "Housing market cycles across Australian cities have become less synchronized since 2010, reflecting divergent economic conditions, migration patterns, and supply responses. This divergence creates both risk and opportunity for investors with multi-market exposure."

The interpretation: **Use consistent metrics and pre-set decision bands across phases.** National sentiment can mislead; suburb-level data reveals reality.

## Investor Lens

### For Newer Investors

**Define rules for action during each phase.** Write down what data would cause you to buy, hold, or wait. Examples:

- "I will consider buying when vacancy falls below 2%, rents are rising 3%+ annually, and clearance rates are above 60%."
- "I will pause acquisitions if clearance rates fall below 55% for 3 consecutive months."
- "I will not sell quality assets during corrections unless forced by cashflow stress."

**Key principles:**
- Focus on fundamentals, not price momentum. Markets with strong employment, constrained supply, and rental demand recover faster.
- Accept that you will not time the bottom or top. Aim for entry during recovery or early expansion when signals align.
- Build buffers before the cycle turns. Corrections reveal who has adequate cashflow margins.

### For Experienced Investors

**Rotate between income and growth acquisitions; plan ahead of phase shifts.**

**Key principles:**
- During expansions, tilt toward constrained markets with growth momentum—but only if buffers are strong.
- During slowdowns, rotate toward defensive quality: middle-ring locations with employment resilience, proven renter demand, and limited new supply.
- During corrections, hold cash and prepare acquisition criteria for recovery signals (vacancy falling, rents rising, clearance stabilizing).
- Use equity strategically across cycles: extract during expansions, preserve during corrections.

**Example:** An experienced investor acquired two properties in Brisbane during recovery (2020). By late 2021 (expansion), they extracted equity and paused further Brisbane acquisitions. In 2023 (correction in Melbourne), they identified a supply-constrained inner-north suburb with 1.2% vacancy and rising rents—entering during weakness with a 5–7 year hold horizon.

## Risks & Considerations

**Over-reacting to short-term data:** A single month's clearance rate or one quarter's price change does not define a cycle. Extend observation windows to 3–6 months before acting.

**Anchoring to headlines:** National media often lags local market reality by 6–12 months. Suburb-level data is more reliable.

**Ignoring supply pipelines:** Markets can show strong current fundamentals but face 2–3 years of oversupply. ABS dwelling approval data and local development application (DA) trackers are essential.

**Mistiming based on emotion:** Fear during corrections and greed during expansions drive poor decisions. Pre-set rules and data-based triggers reduce emotional bias.

## Practical Cycle Monitoring Checklist

Track these indicators monthly for target markets:

1. **Vacancy rate** (target: trending direction, absolute level)
2. **Median rent growth** (year-on-year %, quarterly trend)
3. **Auction clearance rate** (4-week moving average)
4. **Days-on-market** (median DOM, direction of change)
5. **Listings volume** (total active listings, trend vs prior quarter)
6. **Dwelling approvals** (ABS data, 12-month rolling total)
7. **Vendor discounting** (list vs sale price gap, % of discounted sales)
8. **Employment growth** (ABS regional employment data, trend)

When 5–6 indicators align in the same direction, confidence in cycle positioning increases.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cycles reward consistency, not market timing.** Use data and rules, not gut feel or headlines.

2. **Leading indicators—vacancy, rents, clearance rates, DOM—move before prices.** Monitor these 6–12 months ahead of intended action.

3. **Regional and city cycles run at different speeds.** National trends can obscure local opportunity. Zoom into suburb-level data.

4. **Define decision bands for each phase.** Pre-agree what data would cause you to buy, hold, or wait. Remove emotion from execution.

5. **Quality assets in defensible locations recover faster.** Employment resilience, supply constraints, and rental demand matter more than price momentum.
