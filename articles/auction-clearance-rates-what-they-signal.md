# Auction Clearance Rates: What They Signal (and What They Don’t)

> Summary: Clearance rates are a useful temperature check — but only when combined with listings, DOM, vacancy and rents. Treat them as short‑run pulse, not a stand‑alone decision rule.

## Key Takeaways
- Pair clearance rates with listings and DOM; “high + falling DOM + stable supply” is more meaningful than any one metric alone.
- Clearance rates skew urban and house‑heavy; they under‑represent many unit and regional sub‑markets.
- Use trend, not a single weekend print, and keep a city/region filter relevant to your target stock.

## Market Context
Clearance rates reflect auctioned stock outcomes in capital cities. They are timely and noisy. The right way to use them is as part of a short‑run confirmation set with listings and DOM for your target corridor, backed by vacancy/rent dynamics for medium‑term resilience.

## Data Snapshot (Proppy)
- Build a 6‑metric dashboard for your corridor: clearance trend (city), listings YoY, DOM, vacancy, rents YoY, approvals.
- Note: For unit‑heavy or regional markets, clearance rates are weaker proxies — rely more on listings/DOM and rental pressure.

## What the Data Shows
- Constructive read: clearance drifting higher for several weeks while listings are stable or falling, and DOM compresses.
- Mixed: high clearance but rising listings/DOM — bidders exist, but choice is expanding; be price‑disciplined.
- Caution: clearance falling with listings rising and longer DOM — buyer depth thinning; improve buffers or wait.

## Investor Actions
### Newer Investors
- Use clearance rates to time inspections (not to justify overpaying). Pair with on‑market time and comparable sales.
- Keep a “walk away” number; let the data set the pace, not FOMO.

### Experienced Investors
- For growth‑tilted buys, wait for 2–3 weeks of improving clearance coinciding with flat/falling listings in your corridor.
- For yield plays, clearance adds little; focus on vacancy, rents and days‑to‑lease.

## Risks & What to Watch
- Seasonality and holidays distort weekly prints; look at rolling averages.
- Policy or rate news can whipsaw sentiment; don’t react to one weekend.

## Methodology
- Combine auction data with corridor‑level listings/DOM and rental pressure.
- Validate at property level with recent comps and real rent evidence.
