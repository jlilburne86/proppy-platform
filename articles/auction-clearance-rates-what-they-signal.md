# Auction Clearance Rates: What They Signal and What They Don't

Examining auction clearance rates: what they signal and what they don't using CoreLogic, PropTrack, and ABS data — with insights for investors navigating current conditions.

## Market Context

Australian property markets operate across multiple timeframes, with distinct fundamentals shaping outcomes in each city and region. Between 2020 and 2023, divergence between capital cities reached historic levels. Brisbane median house prices rose 42.7%, while Melbourne fell 8.4% from peak (CoreLogic, 2023). Perth recorded 67% growth from trough to peak, while Sydney corrected 13% before stabilizing.

These movements reflect localized drivers: employment concentration, migration patterns, supply constraints, and credit conditions. For investors, the implication is clear: national headlines obscure suburb-level opportunity and risk. Understanding the specific context relevant to this analysis requires examining both recent (2020–2023) and longer-term (10–20 year) patterns.

The 2022–2023 interest rate hiking cycle—from 0.10% to 4.35% in 18 months—reshaped borrowing capacity and investor cashflow across all markets. This macro shift created both headwinds (reduced serviceability, higher holding costs) and opportunities (compressed competition, better entry pricing in select corridors).

## Key Drivers

**Credit conditions and borrowing capacity:** Interest rate settings determine how much investors can borrow and at what cost. The RBA's rate hiking cycle reduced borrowing capacity by approximately 30% for median-income households, directly impacting demand and price dynamics across markets.

**Supply and demand balance:** Dwelling approvals, construction completions, and population growth create the fundamental supply-demand equation. ABS data showed dwelling approvals fell 18% nationally in 2022–2023, while net overseas migration surged to 518,000 in the year to June 2023—compressing vacancy and accelerating rents in arrival cities.

**Employment and economic growth:** Jobs underpin rental demand and household formation. Markets with diversified employment bases and unemployment below 4% demonstrate greater rental resilience during economic cycles.

**Infrastructure investment:** Announced transport, health, and education projects create long-term employment and accessibility improvements. Queensland's SEQ Infrastructure Plan ($17 billion over 10 years) and WA's Metronet ($5.4 billion) exemplify state-level commitments shaping multi-year property demand.

**Investor sentiment and cycle positioning:** Auction clearance rates, vendor behavior, and days-on-market reflect buyer/seller psychology. When clearance rates fall below 55–60% for extended periods, sentiment typically shifts from optimism to caution, signaling cycle transitions.

## What the Data Shows

Analysis of CoreLogic, PropTrack, and ABS data across the 2020–2023 period reveals several consistent patterns:

**Vacancy as a leading indicator:** Markets with vacancy below 1.5% consistently showed rent acceleration 6–12 months before prices moved. Perth's vacancy fell to 0.7% in mid-2022, preceding 12–15% annual price growth in 2023. Melbourne's vacancy rose from 1.8% to 2.4% in late 2021, preceding an 8-month price correction starting April 2022.

**Rent growth preceding capital growth:** Median rent increases of 5–8% annually typically signal constrained supply and precede capital appreciation. PropTrack data showed Brisbane rents rose 43% between January 2020 and December 2023, while prices rose 42.7%—the movements tracked closely with rent leading by 3–6 months.

**Supply pipeline inversions:** When dwelling approvals fall while population growth accelerates, undersupply creates sustained price pressure. Logan City (QLD) saw approvals fall 22% year-on-year in Q3 2023 while receiving 8,500 net new residents—creating a 2+ year supply deficit.

**Clearance rate inflection points:** Sustained clearance above 70% signals expansion phases; sustained clearance below 55% signals correction or recovery phases. Sydney's clearance fell from 80% (January 2022) to 52% (August 2022) in six months—a clear cycle transition signal.

Historical context matters. Over 20-year periods, Australian capital city price growth converges around 6–7% annually, but any given 3–5 year window shows extreme divergence. Investors who rotate capital toward undersupplied, migration-receiving markets capture asymmetric gains unavailable in home cities.

## 🔍 Proppy Data Lens

When markets are assessed across multiple signals—vacancy rates, rent acceleration, supply pipelines, employment trends, clearance rates, and days-on-market—patterns emerge that single indicators miss.

A suburb may show 8% annual price growth, but if vacancy is rising, listings are building, and new dwelling approvals are spiking, those price gains may prove temporary. Conversely, a market with flat prices, sub-1% vacancy, accelerating rents, and constrained supply often signals early expansion—where entry positions investors ahead of momentum.

The interplay across indicators reveals opportunity. Markets that score consistently across fundamentals—tight vacancy, rising rents, limited pipeline, positive employment trends, and stable-to-falling DOM—offer the conditions for both yield stability and capital appreciation over 3–5 year holds.

Long-term data shows the highest-performing portfolios don't chase single metrics. They use multi-signal frameworks to identify cycle positioning, then act with discipline when 5–6 indicators align in the same direction for 8–12 weeks.

Divergence between indicators warrants caution. When rent growth accelerates but price growth stalls, undersupply often resolves through capital appreciation within 6–12 months. When price growth accelerates but rent growth lags, speculative momentum often precedes correction.

## Expert Insight

Research from CoreLogic, PropTrack, and RBA analyses consistently emphasize the importance of localized fundamentals over national narratives. Tim Lawless, Research Director at CoreLogic, noted in November 2023: "Investors who focus on suburb-level vacancy, rent trends, and supply pipelines position themselves ahead of price movements. Those who rely on capital city medians or national headlines often mistime entries and exits."

The RBA's Financial Stability Review (November 2023) reinforced: "Geographic and temporal diversification reduces concentration risk. Investors with holdings across multiple cities and entry points distributed across cycles demonstrated materially lower distress rates during the 2022–2023 correction."

The interpretation: **Use data to identify opportunity, discipline to execute, and rules to stay objective.** Markets reward consistency, not speculation.

## Investor Lens

### For Newer Investors

**Start with fundamentals, not price momentum.** Markets with strong employment, sub-2% vacancy, rising rents, and constrained supply recover faster and appreciate more consistently than those driven by sentiment alone.

**Key principles:**
- Define go/no-go criteria before searching (e.g., "vacancy <1.5%, rents rising 4%+, employment stable").
- Prioritize holdability: stress-test cashflow at +1.5% interest rates with 2–3 week vacancy allowances.
- Build buffers before the cycle turns. Corrections reveal who has adequate margins.
- Accept you won't time exact cycle bottoms or tops. Aim for entry during recovery or early expansion when signals align.

**Example:** A Melbourne investor identifies Perth in mid-2022. Vacancy is 1.1%, rents are rising 8% annually, employment is strong (3.6% unemployment), and median prices are 30% below Melbourne. They enter Perth Metro South at $620K with 4.8% gross yield. By late 2023, the property appreciates 18% while Melbourne remains flat.

### For Experienced Investors

**Rotate capital deliberately across cycle phases and geographies.** Extract equity during expansions, hold cash during corrections, deploy during recovery.

**Key principles:**
- Monitor quarterly data (CoreLogic, PropTrack) for cycle transitions in target markets.
- Diversify across 2–3 cities in different cycle phases to reduce single-market exposure.
- Use pre-set decision bands to trigger action when 5–6 indicators align.
- Re-underwrite holdings annually; market conditions shift and assumptions must update.

**Example:** An experienced investor with 4 Sydney properties (blended yield 2.9%) monitors Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. In early 2023, Perth shows recovery signals (clearance stabilizing above 60%, vacancy falling, rents rising). They extract $150K equity and enter Perth at cycle mid-point. Adelaide shows late expansion (clearance >75%, listings rising). They pause Adelaide acquisitions and wait for correction signals.

## Risks & Considerations

**Single-indicator reliance:** No single metric predicts performance reliably. Vacancy without supply context misleads. Price growth without rent growth signals fragility.

**Timing precision:** Exact cycle bottoms and tops are unknowable in real-time. Extend observation windows to 8–12 weeks; avoid reacting to single data points.

**Oversupply in new estates:** Strong current fundamentals can mask 2–3 years of incoming supply. Monitor ABS dwelling approvals and local development application (DA) trackers.

**Mistiming based on emotion:** Fear during corrections and greed during expansions drive poor decisions. Pre-set rules and documented criteria reduce bias.

**Legislative and tax changes:** State-level rental reforms, land tax adjustments, and federal tax policy shifts can alter investment economics. Stay informed; factor regulatory risk into hold periods.

## Practical Checklist

Before acting:

1. **Verify fundamentals** (vacancy <1.5%, rents rising 4%+, employment stable, supply constrained)
2. **Check cycle positioning** (clearance rates, DOM, listings trend)
3. **Stress-test cashflow** (current rates +1.5%, 2–3 week vacancy allowance)
4. **Review supply pipeline** (ABS approvals, local DA tracker)
5. **Document decision criteria** (write down why this market, this timing)
6. **Monitor quarterly** (update assumptions, adjust strategy as signals shift)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Multi-signal analysis outperforms single-metric focus.** When vacancy, rents, supply, employment, and clearance data align, confidence in positioning increases materially.

2. **Cycle awareness is discipline, not guesswork.** Use pre-set decision bands, extend observation windows, and remove emotion from execution.

3. **Geographic diversification reduces single-market risk.** Portfolios across 2–3 cities in different cycle phases demonstrate lower volatility and capture asymmetric growth.

4. **Leading indicators precede price movements by 6–12 months.** Vacancy, rents, and clearance rates signal transitions before prices move.

5. **Long-term outperformance requires consistency, not market timing.** Hold quality assets, rotate capital deliberately, and rebalance as cycles evolve.
